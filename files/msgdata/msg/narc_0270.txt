Professor, there isn’t anything out\nof the ordinary on the other side,\feither!\r
Professor, there’s nothing out of the\nordinary on the other side, either!\r
Professor: Hmm...\nI may have been mistaken...\rSomething appears to be different\nthan it was before, but...\rFine! It’s enough that we have\nseen the lake.\r
{STRVAR 259, 0}, we’re leaving.\r
Dawn: Professor, how are you enjoying\nbeing back in Sinnoh?\rAfter being away for four years,\nit must be exciting again?\r
Lucas: Professor, you’ve been gone\nfor four years now.\rHow are you enjoying being back in\nSinnoh?\r
Professor: ...Hm.\nThere is one thing I can say.\rThere are many rare kinds of Pokémon\nin Sinnoh.\rThe region should serve us very well\nin regard to our studies.\r
Professor: Excuse me.\nLet us pass, please.\r
Dawn: I beg your pardon...\nWe’ll be on our way.\r
Lucas: Sorry, folks.\r

Dawn: Oh! There’s the briefcase!\rThe professor would have been furious\nif I’d lost it...\r
Dawn: Huh?\nOh, no!\rDid you...\nDid you use the Pokémon in here?\rYou did?! Oh, my gosh!\nWhat’s the professor going to say...?\r...This is so not good...\nI’ll take this briefcase for now.\r

Lucas: Hunh?\nWhaaaat?!\rDid you guys...\nDid you use these Pokémon?!\rOh, man... How am I gonna explain\nthis to the professor?\r...This briefcase is the professor’s,\nso I’ll take it, OK?\r

I don’t know what’s going on.\n{STRVAR 259, 0}, let’s get out of here.\rMy Pokémon got hurt from that\nbattle.\rIf we get attacked by another\nPokémon, we might be in trouble.\r
Rowan: Hmmm...\rNo legendary Pokémon, nothing out\nof the ordinary...\r{STRVAR 259, 0}, how was Lake Valor?\nAnything to report?\rWhat? You’re just going there now?\nYou’ve got to move faster than that!
Rowan: {STRVAR 259, 0}, how was Lake\nValor? Anything to report?\rWhat? You’re just going there now?\nYou’ve got to move faster than that!
Dawn: {STRVAR 259, 0}, how was\nLake Valor?\rThere’s nothing wrong here.\nThe lake hasn’t changed at all.\rWe haven’t found a legendary\nPokémon, either, though...
Lucas: Hiya, {STRVAR 259, 0}!\nHow’s Lake Valor?\rThere’s nothing wrong here.\nThe lake is ordinary, as usual.\rThere’s no legendary Pokémon,\neither...
