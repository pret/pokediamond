Let me tell you about the volcano\nnamed Stark Mountain.\rThat volcano dates to when Sinnoh\nwas made by the melding of time\fand space.\rFiery lava spilled out and pooled,\nand then it turned into a Pokémon.\rIt’s said the Magma Stone was used\nto keep the Pokémon under control.\rOver time, the Pokémon turned into\nthe volcano, according to legend.
You say the Magma Stone was found?\nThe legend was true, then?\rIf so, the volcano’s Pokémon may\nawaken and cause an eruption!
HEATRAN...\nSo there was such a Pokémon?\rDid it come to be when Sinnoh was\ncreated?
Buck: Gotcha, gramps!\nI’ll put the Magma Stone back.\rThat Magma Stone was keeping the\nvolcano Pokémon under control.\rIt’s all right, though.\nI can go put it back myself.\r
