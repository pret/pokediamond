Byron: Hm?\nYou’re in training, then?\rYou know, my son trains as hard as\nyou do.\rBut I still treat him as if he were\na child.\rIt’s ridiculous, really.\nHe is a proper Gym Leader and all.\rIt’s always tricky between a father\nand son, it seems.\rHumph, I’ve wasted your time.\nTake this as my apology!\r
There are Pokémon that evolve into\nthe Steel type using that Metal Coat.\rThey need to hold that item while\nbeing traded to evolve.\rTry using it if you’d like.\nFarewell!\r
