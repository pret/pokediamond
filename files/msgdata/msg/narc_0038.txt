I like making my Pokémon use their\nattacks.\rSometimes, when they get stronger,\nthey learn new moves.\rThose new moves keep things fresh\nand are a fun distraction for me!
Did you buy some Heal Balls at the\nPoké Mart?\rA Heal Ball completely heals the\nPokémon it captures on the spot.\rThat means you can catch a Pokémon\nand have it battle-ready right away.\rOf course, if your team has six\nPokémon in it, it won’t do any good.
