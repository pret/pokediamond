Excuse me, but do you got that\nPokémon named BUIZEL?\rWanna trade it for my CHATOT?
Yes! So awesome! A BUIZEL!\nI so promise I’ll be good to it!\rOh yeah, CHATOT can learn some human\nspeech pretty quickly.\rTry out its move Chatter.\nYou’ll totally see what I mean.
What I totally want is a BUIZEL...
Oh, OK. Totally got it.\nIt’s all right if you don’t want to.\rBut if you change your mind,\nlet’s totally trade some Pokémon.
