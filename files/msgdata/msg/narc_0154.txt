I’ve heard about the Victory Road\nwhich leads to the Pokémon League.\rThe word is the road is harsh and\nharrowing.\rI’d better load up on as many items\nand medicine as I can carry...
You can buy Seals for decorating\nPoké Balls at the Sunyshore Market.\rUse those Seals in a cool way, and\nyour Pokémon will be impressed.
