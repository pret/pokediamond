The reservations were full up,\nbut they managed to get us in here.\rWe’re finally alone, the two of us,\nif you’d leave, that is.\rThis is something we don’t need\nanymore. Will you take it?\r
I’ve always relied on the old\nCoin Toss to make any decision.
That Coin Toss is why we ended up in\nthis musty, old, and stinky suite...
We wanted to be together alone so\nwe could talk without being disturbed.\rWe really need this time together,\njust the two of us.
