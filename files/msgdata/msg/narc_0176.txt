Hello!\nWelcome to the Pokémon League!\rI’m Aaron of the Elite Four.\nIt’s good to meet you.\rOh, I should explain, I’m a huge fan\nof bug Pokémon.\rBug Pokémon are nasty-mean, and yet\nthey’re beautiful, too...\rWould you like to know why I take\non challengers here, in this room?\rIt’s because I want to become\nperfect, just like my bug Pokémon!\rOK! Let me take you on!\r
I lost with the most beautiful and\ntoughest of the bug Pokémon...\rWe lost because I wasn’t good\nenough...\rThat’s it! Back to training camp!\nLet’s hear it for me!\rNo... That was wrong... Anyway...\nGo on to the next room!\rThree Trainers are waiting for you.\nThey’re all tougher than me.
Go on, go to the next room.\rI’m going to become a top-level\nTrainer who can’t be outclassed with\fmy beautiful and tough bug Pokémon!
