Where departed Pokémon sleep...\nThis is the Lost Tower.
There is a broken, crumbling tower\nmade of stone...
There is a broken, crumbling tower\nmade of stone...\rThere seems to be a spot that would\nbe a perfect fit for the Odd Keystone.\rWould you like to use the Odd\nKeystone?
{STRVAR 3, 0} pushed the Odd Keystone\ninto the stone tower.\rThe stone tower has been restored!\n“Hallowed Tower” is written on it.
It’s the Hallowed Tower.\rIt appears to have been built\nmany years ago.
It’s the Hallowed Tower.\rIts stones appear to have shifted...
It’s the Hallowed Tower.\r...Is that crying coming from inside\nthe tower?
It’s the Hallowed Tower.\r...Is the tower shaking ever so\nslightly?
It’s the Hallowed Tower.\rThere is some sort of presence...\nIt appears ready to emerge!
Yulaaah!\r
                                      
Hmm!\n{STRVAR 8, 0} is really good!\rWouldn’t you agree?
Hmm!\nWe’re of identical minds!\rHmm!\nTake this {STRVAR 8, 0}!\r
Try fishing wherever there is\na body of water.\rOh, incidentally, do you need me to\nexplain how to use that fishing rod?
You don’t like to fish?
First, you face any body of water,\nthen you use your fishing rod.\rNext, you must focus!\nIf a Pokémon bites, “!” appears.\fThat’s your cue to reel it in!
When you’re fishing for Pokémon,\nthe first hurdle is getting a bite.\rWhen you start to reel that Pokémon\nin, you’ve got to battle it.\rSo, fishing gives you twice the fun!
Do you jog every morning?\nWell, I do!
When I was jogging the other day,\na wild Pokémon chased after me.\rI swear, I ran on top of the water!\nI was so freaked out!
