I love how my girl has so much\nvivacity and charm.
Thanks to you, my girl’s been in\na really happy mood.
By any chance, do you have a Pokémon\ncalled MEDICHAM?\rIf you do, would you like to trade\nyour MEDICHAM for my HAUNTER?
Haha! Did my HAUNTER turn into\nsomething else? Just kidding!\rI made it hold something that\nprevents it from evolving.\rPlease treat my HAUNTER nicely!\nI’ll be good to your MEDICHAM, too!
What I asked for was a MEDICHAM...?
It’s OK if you don’t want to.\rBut if you change your mind, let’s\ntrade Pokémon.
Thanks to Pokémon, we got to be\nfriends, didn’t we?
