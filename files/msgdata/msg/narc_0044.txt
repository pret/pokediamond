Wi: We come from faraway land.\nI come see the Pokémon I trade.\rI worry if it growing properly.
Fi: I like look at Pokémon I get\nfrom friend in trade.\rIt make me remember my friend!
You can trade Pokémon with people\naround the world on Nintendo WFC...\rJust hearing that gets my heart\nracing. Such exciting times!
When you connect with people on\nNintendo WFC, it’s hard to\ftell if the world’s big or small.
