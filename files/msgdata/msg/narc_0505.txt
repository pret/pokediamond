{SIZE 200}Thud!!{SIZE 100}\r
{STRVAR 3, 0}: What the...\rOh, it’s you, {STRVAR 3, 1}!\rThat old guy... He’s not scary so\nmuch as he is totally out there!\rAww, it doesn’t matter, {STRVAR 3, 1}.\nI’m out of here. See you later!\r
Dawn: Wow, what was that?\rYour friend sure seems to be really\nimpatient.\rWell, anyway...\nLet’s go inside.\r
Lucas: What was that?!\rYour friend always seems to be\nin such a rush.\rAnyway...\nLet’s go in.\r
Dawn: OK, {STRVAR 3, 1}, I’ll act as\nyour mentor.\rI’ve got a bit more experience than\nyou as a Trainer and as the\fprofessor’s assistant.\rOK, follow me!\r
This building with the red roof is\nthe Pokémon Center.\rIt’s the place that heals Pokémon\nthat have been hurt in battle.\rYou can find a Pokémon Center in\nmost towns.\r
The building with the blue roof over\nhere is the Poké Mart.\rIt’s a shop where you can buy and\nsell items and medicine.\r{STRVAR 3, 0}, since you’re a novice\nTrainer, you won’t be able to buy\fmany kinds of merchandise.\rDon’t let it bother you!\r
Oh, that’s right!\n{STRVAR 3, 0}...\rDon’t you need to let your family\nknow that you’re going to be helping\fProf. Rowan with the Pokédex?\rYou may need to go far away, so I\nthink you should let someone know.\rOh, but before you go, heal up your\nPokémon at the Poké Center.\rIt will be a lot less scary that way.\nOK, bye now!\r
                                   
{STRVAR 3, 0}: Hey, {STRVAR 3, 1}!\nI want to show you a few things.\fSo, follow me!\r
This building with the red roof is\nthe Pokémon Center.\rYou can get your Pokémon healed if\nit’s been hurt in battle.\rYou’ll find a Pokémon Center in most\ntowns.\r
Over here, the building with the blue\nroof is the Poké Mart.\rIt’s a shop where you can buy and\nsell all sorts of items.\r{STRVAR 3, 0}, since you’re a rookie\nTrainer, you won’t be able to buy\fvery much stuff.\rDon’t worry about it, OK?\r
Oh, yeah, right!\n{STRVAR 3, 0}...\rYou should let your family know\nyou’re helping Prof. Rowan put\ftogether his Pokédex.\rSometimes, you have to go far away,\nso you should let someone know.\rOh, but first, go heal up your\nPokémon at the Poké Center.\rYou’ll be safe then.\nOK, be seeing you!\r
Oh, wow!\nPokémon are so cool!\rYou can make yours battle and make\nthem stronger!\rI wish I had some!\nIt’s so cool!
That thing you have!\rIt’s a Pokédex, isn’t it?!\rYou’re off to see all kinds of\nPokémon now! Lucky you!
So I don’t forget what’s happened,\ntill now, I’d better save this...\rThere!\nNow I can take a break.
Professor Rowan’s come back to town!\rIt must be, like, four years since\nhe left.\rThey say he was doing his research\nsomewhere else all this time.
