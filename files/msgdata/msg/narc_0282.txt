What I most care about is the\ncrushing power of my darling Pokémon.\rAre there any prizes that would\nhelp them get more power?
How’s it going?\rIf things aren’t going well, why not\ngrab some prizes here?\rIt might toughen up your Pokémon\njust enough to do better.
Gramma, Gramma!\nI went and traded!\rYou can have this, Gramma!\r
Oh, what is it, dear?\nOh, a Sludge Bomb...\rWhy, thank you so much, dear.\rYou’re such a cute, tough, and kind\ngirl...\rI feel blessed to have a grandchild\nlike you...
