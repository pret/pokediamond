Boss: ...I see. You must be the\nTrainer I’ve been hearing about.\rThe foolhardy one that’s trying to\nstand up to Team Galactic.\rAlthough I’d hardly expected to\nsee that the Trainer is a mere child.\rI’d heard that our Commanders had\na rough time with you...\r
I know why you’re here, I can sense\nit in you.\rIt’s about UXIE, MESPRIT, and AZELF,\ncorrect? You want to save them...\rI no longer have any need for them.\nI am finished with them.\rIf your heart aches to save them,\ngo right ahead, I could care less.\rIt will save me the trouble of\ndisposing of them.\rBut, I must say...\nYou are a remarkable specimen.\rThose Pokémon have nothing to do\nwith you, do they not?\rBut still you came to rescue them\nout of pity?\rSuch pitifully useless emotions...\nIt’s illogical and irrational.\rPity and compassion are products of\nthe weak and lacking human heart.\rYou were compelled to come here by\nsuch vacuous sentimentality!\rI will make you regret paying\nheed to your heart!\r
Boss: I see.\nYou are indeed strong.\rAnd the basis of your power is your\ncompassion toward Pokémon.\r...How wasteful...\nSuch emotions are but mere illusions.\rAnd, like all illusions, they fade\nover time until death banishes them\fforever.\rThat is why I have abandoned all\nemotions as useless sentimentality.\r...But that doesn’t matter. I doubt\nyou will ever understand my position.\rThat said, I recognize that you are\nstrong and courageous to come alone.\rThis is your reward.\r
Boss: The Master Ball is the ultimate\nPoké Ball.\rIt will unfailingly catch any Pokémon\nin the wild.\rBut it is not anything that I require.\rUnlike you Trainers, I do not make\nPokémon my friends or partners.\rUnlike other Team Galactic members,\nI don’t use Pokémon as tools.\rInstead, I make the power of Pokémon\nmy own.\r
If you wish to save the Pokémon from\nthe lakes, take the warp panel ahead.\rI am off to Mt. Coronet.\rThat’s correct. Mt. Coronet.\nWhere you and I first met.\rI will ascend the mountain to its\npeak and put an end to everything...\rNo. I will bring about a new beginning\nfor everything...\r

Team Galactic Report\r
Which report would you like to read?
Some say the universe originated\nfrom a massive explosion.\rSimilarly, Sinnoh is thought to have\nbeen formed by an explosion in\fancient times.\rNeedless to say, the explosion came\nfrom the power of a Pokémon.\rThe Pokémon must have been the\nmythical creature considered\fa deity by the ancients.\rOur aim is not to capture the\nmythical Pokémon, but to obtain its\fpower...\rThe PC entry ends there...\r
The mythical Pokémon...\rAccording to myths, the Pokémon\ncreated Sinnoh with its power.\rHowever, capturing the Pokémon with\na Poké Ball prevents it from using\fits full power...\rBut with the Red Chain, the Pokémon\ncan be shackled, and its power can\fbe used without restraint...\rThe PC entry ends there...\r
The Red Chain...\rThe Pokémon of the three lakes and\nMt. Coronet are somehow connected.\rCapturing the Pokémon of the lakes\nwill free the Pokémon of Mt. Coronet.\rFrom the Pokémon of the lakes,\ncrystals can be extracted to create\fa Red Chain.\rUsing that Red Chain, the mythical\nPokémon can be summoned and shackled\fto do as we command...\rThe PC entry ends there...\r
