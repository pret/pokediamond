Ah, you have a Pokétch?\nYou will find it indispensable.\rScience will become increasingly\nnecessary in the world of Pokémon.\r
My name is Cyrus.\rI am but another human seeking to\nbecome Sinnoh’s greatest Trainer.\rIf you’re also a Trainer, then do\nyour best to gain power.\rBe all that you can become.
                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                              
Grunt 1: Aren’t we Team Galactic?\nAnd we’re assigned here?\rStanding around among flowers...\nThis doesn’t seem all that cool.\r
Grunt 2: Hey now! Don’t complain.\nThis is a pretty decent assignment.\rBut Bug- and Grass-type\nPokémon so creep me out...\rI don’t like being here either.
I wanted to get some flowers from\nthe Floaroma Meadow...\rBut some Team Galactic guys in\nsnazzy outfits came along...\r
Those Galactic guys went to the\nmeadow past these flowers here...
Being surrounded by flowers puts me\nin an oddly pleasant mood.
I simply love it here...\nThe atmosphere is so uplifting.\rYou came to get emotionally healed\ntoo, didn’t you?
Welcome to Floaroma, the town of\nflowers, flowers, and more flowers!\rYou should plant some flowers of\nyour own, too. Yay for flowers!
The Berries you pick can be used as\nfood for Pokémon.\rYou can also exchange them at\nthe florist’s for Accessories to\fdress up your Pokémon.
I got drawn here by the sweet scent\nof Honey...\rSeriously, what’s that? What am I?\nA Pokémon or something? Mmm... Honey.
