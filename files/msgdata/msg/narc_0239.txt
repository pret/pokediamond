The flowers that grow in the fields\nhere are special.\rDo you see how they’re more vivid\nthan flowers elsewhere in Sinnoh?\rYou can thank Pokémon for that.
If you put Honey on a tree, check\nback later to see if it’s rustling.\rIf it is, it’s quite often a rare\nPokémon.\rIt gets my hopes up if I see that\nhappening.
