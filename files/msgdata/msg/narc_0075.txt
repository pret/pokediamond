The Oreburgh Mine is operated\nwith the utmost care.\rWe avoid causing any damage to\nthe natural habitats of Pokémon.
Wow... Your Pokémon’s eyes are\ntwinkling brightly!\rSeeing that makes me happy!\nHere, I want you to have this!\r
You know how Pokémon stay inside\ntheir Poké Balls?\rI try to think about what would be\nthe best Poké Balls for them.
                                                 
The whole system of taking the coal\nout of the mine is automated.\rThere’s nothing backbreaking about\nit!
