I’ve had this TM Recycle for such\na long time now.\rIt’s not anything that I have much\nuse for these days.\rI do hope you’ll put it to good\nuse, young Trainer.\r
Folks like me have a long history\nwe can look back on.\rYoung people like you have only the\nfuture to look forward to.
Gardenia, our Gym Leader, goes out\nto Eterna Forest every so often.\rI always wonder what she does there.
