Breathing in this refreshing air...\rIt even perks up Pokémon!\nThat’s why I’m out here.
Howdy, traveling Trainer.\rThere’s no Gym in this town. You’ll\nbe wanting Veilstone or Pastoria.
Howdy, traveling Trainer.\nTake it easy, slow, and casual.
I’m too little, so I don’t know\nhow to battle very good.\rThe nice Day-Care Lady is raising\nmy Pokémon for me.
Every Sunday, I visit the Lost\nTower...
There used to be nothing here but\na road that went straight through.\rOver time, Pokémon and people just\ngathered, and the town came to be.
A traveling Trainer, huh?\rTell me, how many kinds of Pokémon\nhave you met so far?\rIf you’re a competent Trainer, I’d\nthink you’d’ve met at least fifty.\rIf you haven’t, you ought to go\nfarther abroad and look harder.
Your encounters with Pokémon can\nbe considered your shared history.\rThis here’s a Pokétch app called\nPokémon History.\rUse it to see your history of\nPokémon catches.\r
You have your history, and every\nPokémon has their own history.\rWhen the two collide, new drama\nis born.
