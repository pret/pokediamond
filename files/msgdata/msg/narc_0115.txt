Well, now, you’re a Trainer?\rThat makes you both papa and mama\nto your Pokémon.\rYou know how having Pokémon around\nleads to new discoveries?\rIt’s the same for parents and kids.\nI’m always learning from my kids.
Kuufu fuu!
Babies and Pokémon get along\nperfectly together.\rWhen babies take naps, Pokémon go\nto sleep right next to them.
When I get bigger, I’m going to be\na Trainer, too!
When I grow up, I want to become\na Pokémon coordinator.
...My sisters get all the attention.\nNo one even notices me.
Oh, wow, you’re a Pokémon Trainer.\rHaving lots of Pokémon around is\na lot of responsibility.\rBut that also comes with a lot\nof fun!
