Floaroma Town was a barren, desolate\nhill long ago.\rPeople started planting flowers on it\nbecause it was such a sad place.\rBut nothing would grow...\nPeople didn’t know what to do...\rAnd then one day, someone expressed\nthanks for the blessings of nature.\rThen, the whole hill burst into bloom.\nIsn’t that strange and wonderful?
Do you think it’s cute how\nPokémon pluck Berries?
Yes! You agreed!\nHere’s the TM for the move Pluck!\r
Oh...\nI guess I just like weird things...
When a Pokémon uses Pluck, it eats\na Berry held by its foe in battle.\rI like how it steals a Berry.\nIt’s so cute!
CLEFAIRY: Rii?
