Pokémon from around the country\ncan be brought here.\rIn other words, Pokémon from\nplaces like Kanto and Hoenn.\rThis place also happens to be where\nyou compete to see how quickly you\fcan catch those Pokémon!\r
It’s good to see you’ve come\nto join us for a visit.\rLet me make a gift of this Trainer\nCounter for your Pokétch.\r
Oak: I plan to be in Eterna City\nfor some time.\rBeing here, I should make the best\nof my time studying the Pokémon of\fthe Sinnoh region.\r
Pal Park is so scintillating!\rTrainers and Pokémon are so full of\nintent here!\r
I’ve never seen some Pokémon.\nWould you show me if you had one?\r
                                    
                                                                   
                                                      
Let me see...\rA Pokémon that does nothing but\neat and sleep.\r
Oh, a SNORLAX?\nIt sure looks like it can eat!\rI have a Pokétch app that has\na SNORLAX motif.\rYou can have it for showing me\na real SNORLAX!\r
Doesn’t that {STRVAR 24, 0}\nmake you want to cook something?\n
Let me see...\rA Pokémon that changes color\nwhenever something happens.\r
Oh, a KECLEON!\nHow colorful!\rI have a Pokétch app that features\na KECLEON design.\rYou can have it for showing me\na real KECLEON!\r
Changing colors can change your\nmood, too.
                                  
                                                                    
                                    
What was that Pokémon’s name now...?\nOh, it’s on the tip of my tongue!
Pal Park is so scintillating!\rTrainers and Pokémon are so full of\nintent here!\rAre you taking the challenge, too?

Yes! You agreed to participate!\nIt’s a happy day for me!\rLet’s not waste any time!\nLet me explain how Pal Park works.\rI wrote the Pal Park manual for\nsituations just like this.\rWhat should I explain?
Pal Park is a place where you are\ntimed on the catching of six Pokémon.\rYou are provided with six special\nPoké Balls for the challenge.\rParticipating Trainers are required to\nsupply the six Pokémon that are to\fbe caught.\rIf you do not supply the stock of six\nPokémon, you may not participate in\fthe Catching Show.\r...Do you want me to explain anything\nelse?
At the start of the Catching Show,\nyou will be given six Park Balls.\rUse the Park Balls to catch the\nsix Pokémon you provide.\r...Do you want me to explain anything\nelse?
You may make Pokémon migrate from\nKanto or Hoenn to stock your\fCatching Game.\rInsert a Game Boy Advance Pokémon\nRuby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed,\for LeafGreen in the Game Pak Slot.\rWhen your DS is turned on, currently\ncaught Pokémon can migrate from\fthe Game Pak to the DS Game Card.\r...Do you want me to explain anything\nelse?
Pokémon caught in Sinnoh may also\nbe used to stock your Catching Game.\rPlease ask the guy next to me who’s\nin charge of stocking Pokémon.\r...Do you want me to explain anything\nelse?
Would you like to take part in\na Catching Show now?
Aww, that’s too bad.\rWell, just give me a shout if you’d\nlike to participate.

Oh, hold on. You don’t have enough\nPokémon for a Catching Show.\rYou’ll need to stock us with six\nPokémon to participate.\rYou should make some Pokémon migrate\nfrom Kanto or Hoenn!
Very well, let me explain how things\nwork around here.\rI’ll read to you from the Pal Park\nmanual I wrote.
I’m sorry you had to retire.\nWe hope you try harder next time.\rI’ll take what Park Balls you\nhave left.\rNext time, please do stay to catch\nall six Pokémon.
Oh, your PC Boxes are filled. You\nhave no room for six more Pokémon.\rYou won’t be able to accept them,\neven if you do catch them.\rMake enough room in a PC Box and\ncome back for your Catching Show.
Congratulations!\nThat’s all six Pokémon caught!\rThe audience sure enjoyed watching\nyour Catching Show.\rAll right, let’s see your all-important\nscore from this show!\r...\n...\rCatching Points: {STRVAR 53, 0}!\rTime Points: {STRVAR 53, 1}!\rType Points: {STRVAR 53, 2}!\rThe total is...\r...\n...\r{STRVAR 53, 3} points!\r
Wow! That’s an outstanding record!\nKudos to you!\r
Good! That’s a decent record.\nProps to you!\r
Would you like to put all the Pokémon\nyou’ve caught in PC Boxes?
Done!\nYour Pokémon have been boxed away.\rYou’ll now have to save the game.\r
Oh, then it might be fun for you to\ngo for an even better score by\ftrying to catch these six again.\rIf you want to do another Catching\nShow, just come see us!
If you want to do another Catching\nShow, come see us again!
It’s time for your prize!\nHere you are!\r

People come here not only to see\nthe Catching Show.\rWe get to see rare and exotic\nPokémon on top of the catches.\rThe excitement gets me all jacked up!
The current record holder is\n{STRVAR 3, 1} with {STRVAR 53, 2} points.\fCan you top that?

Your Bag is full.\nYou should come back later.
I’ve heard Trainers complain that\nrare Pokémon take longer to appear.\rIs it easier to start with common\nPokémon?
The Catching Show...\rIt’s a head-on clash of will and\nwits between Trainer and Pokémon.\rI especially look forward to seeing\nPokémon from Kanto and Hoenn.\rBut it tugs at my heartstrings to\nknow they’re so far away from home.
Your performance left my heart\naflutter today...\rI must crown you with this...\nCrown.\rOh, before you get the wrong idea,\nit’s an Accessory for Pokémon.\r
Your performance left my heart\naflutter today...\rI feel compelled to give you this\nTiara.\rOh, before you get the wrong idea,\nit’s an Accessory for Pokémon.\r
