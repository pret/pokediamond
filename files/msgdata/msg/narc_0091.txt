I gathered up a lot of Berries, so\nI’m trading them in for Accessories.\rI’m this close to being ready for\nthe Contests in Hearthome City.
Badges from Gyms, or Contest wins...\nThere’s more than just one way to\rbe a winner, it seems.\nHere’s hoping you’ll find something\rin which you can be the victor.
Hahaha! I’ve got you now!\nI’m gonna take your Flag!
You can’t catch me!\nI set some Traps!
