Grr... The package hasn’t arrived\nfrom the Veilstone warehouse yet...\rI have to wait here until then?\nI’m going batty from this wait...\rOh, man, I wish I could do something\nthat involved lots of explosives!\rYup, this is going to be a smashing\njob for Team Galactic...
Grr...\nThis is so annoying...\rWhat is it, you? Oh, some kid with\nonly three Gym Badges.\rLittle buggers like you should know\nto stay out of Team Galactic’s way!\r...Now, this package from Veilstone...\nWhere should I set it off...?\rYup, this is going to be a smashing\njob for Team Galactic...
Hahah! The package finally came from\nthe Veilstone warehouse!\rSo, now it’s my job to deliver this\nto the lake!\rThis is an important mission.\nNo failure allowed!\rNo making boo-boos like wandering\noff into the Great Marsh!\r
You were eavesdropping!\nI was just talking loudly to myself!\rIf I wasn’t in a hurry, I’d pulverize\nyou with my Pokémon!\rBut I have to get on my way to the\nlake ASAP! So, you’re lucky! I’m out!\rOh, and listen up, you!\nDon’t you dare follow me!\r
Gweh!\nPersistent pest!\rIf our plan works, our boss’s dream\ncomes closer to fruition!\rOur boss’s ideal world is going\nto be created!\rSo, I’m not going to waste my time\non a nobody like you!\rI’m telling you now, don’t you come\nchasing after me!\r
{STRVAR 3, 0}: Whoops!\rHehehe! I’m not always going to plow\ninto you every time we meet!\rSo how’s it going, {STRVAR 3, 1}?\nBuffing up your Pokémon, eh?\rI’ll test you and your Pokémon out\nto see how buff and tough you are!\r
{STRVAR 3, 0}: Heh, yeah, maybe you\ndid get a bit tougher since last time.\rThat even shocked me a bit, so yeah,\nI got beat ’cause I was careless.\rSo, hey, what was that Team Galactic\nguy all freaking out about?\rI don’t know what he’s up to, but\nyou should chase him down!\rIf you’re not a Pokémon, and you run\nlike that... You’re a bad guy.\rAll right, {STRVAR 3, 1}!\nNext time, I’m not holding back!\r
                                                                                                                                                                                    
Here where I am standing, I’m\nsmack-dab in the middle of town.
I study rare Pokémon that appear\nonly in the Great Marsh.
Some Trainers deliberately prevent\ntheir Pokémon from evolving.\rThey wait until the Pokémon levels up\nand learns certain moves.
I’m visiting the area because I\nwanted to see the Great Marsh.\rI’m staying at the lakeside hotel.
Pastoria’s Gym Leader is like...\nBreathtaking... In a weird way.\rIt’s hard to explain.\nYou’ll know what I mean, though.
Wasn’t the Pastoria Gym Leader\nkind of breathtaking in a weird way?\rBut don’t judge him by the way\nhe looks and acts.\rI hear he uses the prize money to\nhelp people and Pokémon in trouble.
The Great Marsh keeps the weather\ncool in the summertime.\rThis is a good town for Water-type\nPokémon.
CLEFAIRY: Fiiih?!
You’re just like a totally impatient\nboy I met earlier.\rJust like you, he was very close with\nhis Pokémon.\rHey, thanks for making me smile!\nThis might put a smile on your face.\rTry dressing up a Pokémon with\nthis {STRVAR 31, 0}.\r
Someone gave me a Berry, so I\nplanted it and grew some more.\rThen, I took the Berries and cooked\nthem into Poffins.\rAll the work is worth it when I see\nhow happy they make my Pokémon!
Someone in the Great Marsh offered\nme a Hidden Machine, but I declined.\rI don’t need it ’cause the Gym\nLeader will do Defog for us\fif we ever need it in this city.
Have you been to the Pokémon\nMansion?\rThe owner, Mr. Backlot, likes to brag\nabout his rare Pokémon.
