Someone broke my Pokémon-catching\nrecord!\rI’ll reclaim my record and regain\nmy place in the standings!
My name isn’t on the rankings?\nWhat kind of nonsense is that?!\r...It’s because I’ve never taken\npart in a Contest.\rI bet it’d feel great if I could\nbe number one here!
I really don’t win many battles...\nBut it doesn’t get me down.\rI’m trying for the world record\nat Pokémon fishing!
Sorry, I’m still fine-tuning this\nthingy here.
