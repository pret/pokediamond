I had a dream!\nIt was a wonderful dream!\rI dreamt that a Trainer would bring\nme a giant REMORAID!\rOh, my gosh!\nThat dream was no dream!\rH-how big of a REMORAID did you\nbring me?!

{STRVAR 52, 0}.{STRVAR 50, 1} inches...\nAm I experiencing deja vu?\fI distinctly remember this size...
This REMORAID was {STRVAR 52, 0}.{STRVAR 50, 1} inches.\rI know a genius who brought me\na REMORAID that was {STRVAR 52, 2}.{STRVAR 50, 3} inches...
