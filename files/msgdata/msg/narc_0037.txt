Oh, your Pokémon is quite adorable!\rHere, try making it hold this\n{STRVAR 264, 1, 0}.\r
A Pokémon holding that Quick Claw can\nsometimes attack first, even if it\fis normally a little bit slow.\rThere are other items that are only\nuseful when given to a Pokémon.\rTry finding other items that you can\nmake your Pokémon hold.\r...I sound like I’m a teacher or\nsomething.
