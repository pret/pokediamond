Hello, hello!\nHow, I say, do you do?\rI am the Pokémon Fan Club Chairman!\nIndeed, yes I am!\rWhen you wish to treat your Pokémon\nto a treat, what, I say, do you do?\rIf I may say so, and I will, I feed\nPoffins to my Pokémon!\rAnd why, I say, would I do that?\rBecause the giving of Poffins is\na way of expressing your love!\rFor example! If I were to give a\nSweet Poffin, the Pokémon eating it\fwould become more cute!\rFor example! A Spicy Poffin will add\nto the coolness of a Pokémon!\rIn such ways I say that Poffins have\nnothing but goodness for Pokémon!\rTherefore!\rI declare this Poffin Case to be\na gift from me to you!\r
I urge you to fill it with Poffins\nand be generous in dispensing them\fto your Pokémon!
Nationwide, there are other fan\nclubs, but we are number one!\rAnd why are we number one?\nBecause I brag more than anyone!\rBut now I can’t brag as much...\rPeople started complaining, so\nI’ve had to curtail my bragging...
Welcome to the Pokémon Fan Club!\nOh, your {STRVAR_1 0, 0}...\r
It simply adores you!\nWhy, I feel like I’m intruding!
It’s very friendly toward you.\nI can tell you treat it kindly.
It’s quite friendly to you.\nIt must be happy being with you.
It’s warming up to you.\nThat’s my impression.
It’s feeling neutral toward you.\nIt’s up to you to change that.
Hmm...\nIt seems to dislike you a little.
Oh, my... I think this one really\nhasn’t taken too kindly to you.
PSYDUCK: Gua gwah?!
BUNEARY: Kukuuh.
CLEFAIRY: Pip piiih!
