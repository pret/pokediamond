The temple is said to have been\nbuilt in ancient times.\rIt pays homage to the Pokémon\nof rock, ice, and steel that shape\fthe land.\rSo it is told.
Candice: It’s OK!\nYou can let that person in.\r
Cynthia sent word to me.\rYou’re working on a Pokédex,\naren’t you?\rThere should be many rare Pokémon\nin the temple.\rEnjoy your exploring!
Brrr... This snowbound town is\nalways freezing cold.\rBut the spirits of the Trainers and\ntheir Pokémon burn hot and bright.\rEspecially the Gym Leader.
Ewww, aren’t you cold with just\nthat scarf? Yikes!
You’re going to the Snowpoint Temple?\nYou know you’re not allowed to go in?

Candice is teaching me about Pokémon.\rShe says I have to start by making\nfriends with Pokémon.
What is it? Do you want to sail\nto the Battle Zone?
Aye, aye, then!\nLet’s set sail!\r
