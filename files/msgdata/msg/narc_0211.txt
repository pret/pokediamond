What?! No way!\nYou have the key?\rLocking the door was meaningless!\nI am the loser in this after all!\rThis is no time for self-pity!\nI’ve got to alert the Commander!\r
My Pokémon can’t battle anymore.\rThey’re gonna take away my Pokémon\nfor messing this one up...\rHumph! Just you wait!\nOur Commander will smoosh you!
I’m one of Team Galactic’s three\nCommanders.\rWe’ve been trying to create a new\nworld that’s better than this one...\rBut people have shown little\nunderstanding about what we do.\rYou don’t understand either, do you?\nIt’s a little saddening...\rSo, let’s have a battle to decide\nwhat we should do next.\rIf I win, you leave.\rIf you win, we, Team Galactic, will\nleave!\r
Oops!\nI messed that one up!\rThat’s all right, though.\nI quite enjoyed our battle.\rI guess it’s time to say good-bye\nand leave for the time being!\r
Team Galactic...\rThey were saying they had to gather\nPokémon and energy no matter what.\rIt was for creating a new universe,\nor so they claimed.\rNothing they said made any sort\nof sense to me.\rI can’t tell you how grateful\nI am for saving me.\rI can finally see my little daughter\nagain!\r
Little girl: Papa!\rYuck! Papa, you’re stinky!\nGo shower now, stinky!\r
Papa: Oh, sorry! Ahaha!\nThey had me working nonstop!\r
Little girl: Thank you, Trainer!\nYou made those bad people go away!\rI think the balloon Pokémon will\ncome visiting again!
Papa: Oh, yes, a balloon Pokémon\nappears in front of the windworks.\rIt’s always a certain day of the\nweek, but I’m not sure which day.\rCould its appearance have something\nto do with this windworks\fusing wind-generated energy?
The Valley Windworks uses turbines\nto capture energy from winds driven\ffrom the mountains in this canyon.\rWe produce energy from the power of\nnature itself. It’s quite wonderful.
If the balloon Pokémon came,\nthe wind would blow it away!
