                                                                                 
                                                  
                                                                 
                                                                   
Rowan: Ah, {STRVAR_1 3, 0}!\nWhat timing!\rThose Team Galactic scoundrels are\nafter the legendary Pokémon!\rYou’ve got to help Dawn!
Rowan: Ah, {STRVAR_1 3, 0}!\nWhat timing!\rThose Team Galactic scoundrels are\nafter the legendary Pokémon!\r{STRVAR_1 3, 0}, help us!\nYou’ve got to help Lucas!
Rowan: How dare you!\nYou misguided thugs!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0}!\nDawn needs your help!
Rowan: How dare you!\nYou misguided thugs!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0}!\nLucas needs your help!
Ow! Ouch!\nWhat’s with this old-timer?
Dawn: {STRVAR_1 3, 0}!\nIt’s T-Team Galactic!\fOh no! The Pokémon of the lake...
Lucas: It’s Team Galactic!\nThey took the Pokémon of the lake...
Mars: That face...!\nIt brings back bad memories!\rI’m talking about the windworks!\rI caught a whole lot of trouble\nfor that little incident.\rWhat’s with that look on your face?\nYou do remember me, don’t you?\rFine, whatever.\nI’ll tell you who I am again!\rI’m Mars, one of Team Galactic’s\nCommanders.\rSo, what is it? Are you some\nlovey-dovey couple to the rescue?\rNot a chance! Not even a teeny one!\nYou’re all going down!\r
I lost again...\rSo, first the windworks, and now\nLake Verity that I owe you for!\rThis shouldn’t be happening to Team\nGalactic’s Commander...\r...Calm down, Mars...\nI’ve done my part in all of this...\rMy mission was to transport the\nlake’s Pokémon to our HQ...\r...That’s right! I accomplished my\nmission without a problem!\r
Team! We’re pulling out!\nThe boss is waiting at the HQ!\r
The Pokémon of the three lakes are\nconnected somehow.\rThanks to Saturn’s grandstanding at\nLake Valor, a cavern appeared here.\rIt was the cavern where the Pokémon\nMESPRIT slept.\rMESPRIT appeared, too, probably to\ngo help its friends.\rThat worked out well for us.\nIt was super easy to catch.\rSo, now we’ve got them all:\nMESPRIT, “the Being of Emotion.”\fAZELF, “the Being of Willpower.”\fUXIE, “the Being of Intelligence.”\rNow that we have them all...\rYou can look forward to what plans\nTeam Galactic has for them!\r
Rowan: I see...\nThis also occurred at Lake Valor...\rAnother legendary Pokémon was taken\naway by Team Galactic...\rBoth of you went up against\nfull-fledged criminals...\rThe fact that you’re unharmed is\nreason enough to celebrate.\r...But what about Lake Acuity?\nIs {STRVAR_1 3, 0} safe?
Rowan: {STRVAR_1 3, 0}, I need you to\ngo to Lake Acuity right away.\rI’m worried about {STRVAR_1 3, 1}.
Dawn: {STRVAR_1 3, 0}, what is Team\nGalactic up to?\rAre the abducted Pokémon of the\nlakes going to be OK?
Lucas: {STRVAR_1 3, 0}, what’s Team\nGalactic up to?\rThey’d better not harm the Pokémon\nthey took from the lakes...
