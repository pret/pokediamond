Using that move, the Pokémon hurls\nwhatever item it’s holding at the foe.\rThe move’s effect depends on what\nitem is hurled.\rRemember, the move Fling fails if the\nPokémon isn’t holding anything.
When I first started fishing, catching\nanything made me happy.\rBut those days are long gone now...\rNow I get annoyed if I can’t beat my\nrecord by even an inch...
I can’t explain it.\nI get more easily agitated at night.
