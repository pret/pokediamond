Buck: Yo, if it isn’t {STRVAR 3, 0}!\rDon’t tell me you’re going to Stark\nMountain, too?\rYou’re pretty wimpy...\nYou’re sure you’re going to be OK?\rHeh, why am I asking you that?\nIt’s not like I care.\rAnyways, if we see each other on\nStark Mountain, the race is on to\fsee who gets the Magma Stone first!\r
Wake: Oh, if it isn’t {STRVAR 3, 0}!\nIt’s been a while!\rYou’ve grown so tough that you’re\ntraining out here now...\rEveryone keeps getting tougher and\ntougher...\rAnd, in doing that, they develop\ncloser bonds with their Pokémon...\r
{STRVAR 3, 1}: ...For someone born\noverseas, that tough dude doesn’t\fhave an accent or anything.\r
{STRVAR 3, 0}, there’s a volcano\nahead of us called Stark Mountain.\rThat blowhard Buck guy is on his way\nthere, as well.\rI’m going to find the volcano’s\ntreasure before that guy does.\rIf I could do that, a 21-win streak\nat the Battle Tower’d be possible!\r
Wake: ...You’re serious?\nYou’re going to Stark Mountain?\rEven the wild Pokémon there are\nvery, very tough...\rIf your Pokémon aren’t well trained,\nthey’ll have a miserable time...\rThen again, that kind of challenge\nis an exciting prospect...\rBut no matter what, you’d better\nbe fully prepared!\rI’ve got to get ready for another\ntournament. Farewell!\r
