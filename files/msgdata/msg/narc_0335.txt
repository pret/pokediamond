Rowan: Ah, {STRVAR 259, 0}!\rYou’ve come to show me the progress\nyou’ve made on your Pokédex?
Hmm...\rYou’ve spotted {STRVAR 308, 0} Pokémon in\nSinnoh...\r
What’s wrong?\rYou’re not suggesting you’ve seen so\nfew that you’re afraid to show me?
Rowan: You’re working hard on your\nNational Pokédex I see.\rI expect big things from you!
I see!\rYou’ve met all the Pokémon there\nare in Sinnoh!\r{STRVAR 259, 0}, I need to see you\nat my lab. I’ll be waiting!
I see!\rYou’ve met all the Pokémon there\nare in Sinnoh!
Look harder for wild Pokémon.\rDon’t be afraid of going into tall\ngrass.
Your pace is picking up.\nThings can only get better!
Be persistent when you’re searching\nfor Pokémon that appear only in\fcertain places.
Pokémon aren’t hiding only in\ntall grass.\rYou can find many others in caves\nand seas.
Your Pokédex is looking more and more\nrespectable!
Are you fishing with rods?\rPokémon that live underwater need\nto be caught by fishing.
The Trainers that challenge you to\nbattle have Pokémon, obviously.\rThey may have rare ones with them,\nand that can add to your Pokédex.
Your Pokédex is well on the way to\nbeing filled up.\rThis Pokédex can be considered\na journal of your adventure.
You’re not far from seeing every\nPokémon there is to see in Sinnoh!
Oak: Ah, {STRVAR 259, 0}!\rYou’ve come to show me how\nyour Pokédex is coming along?
Oak: Ah, {STRVAR 259, 0}!\rYou’ve come to show me how\nyour Pokédex is coming along?
Hmhm...\nYou’ve caught {STRVAR 308, 0} so far...\r
I see...\rCome see me if you’d like me to have\na look at your Pokédex.
They say there are at least 400\nspecies of Pokémon nationwide.\rIf you’re planning to catch them all,\nyou’d better be a committed Trainer.
Hm! Little by little, you’re filling\nthe Pokédex with complete\fdata on Pokémon you’ve gotten.\rKeep up the good work!
Here’s a tip on catching Pokémon\nin the wild.\rMinimize their HP before you throw\nout your Poké Ball to catch ’em.
Remember: If you can’t catch them,\nyou can always trade for them.\rAs soon as you trade, the Pokémon’s\ndata is added to the Pokédex.\rThat’s why you should seek out\nas many trades as possible.
Have you visited the Great Marsh?\rSome Pokémon only appear in places\nsuch as that.
As you know, there are Pokémon\nthat eventually evolve.\rThat’s an important thing to consider\nwhen you’re filling your Pokédex.
You’ve proven yourself capable.\nThere’s nothing to worry about.\rKeep catching Pokémon the way you’ve\nbeen doing so far.
Are you aware that there is more\nthan one style of evolution?\rThere are some Pokémon that evolve\nby becoming friends with the Trainer.
Apparently, there are some Pokémon\nthat appear in swarms on occasion.\rDon’t miss out on these massive\noutbreaks of Pokémon!
Amazing! You’ve already gotten over\n300 Pokémon!\rThat’s already a major achievement,\nbut I know you’re capable of more!
Some wild Pokémon only appear during\ncertain times of the day.\rYou’ll need to look for Pokémon\naround the clock.
I’ve been getting reports of\ndifferent Pokémon sightings.\rBy different, I mean Pokémon that\naren’t native to the Sinnoh region.\rYou should perhaps go back to\nareas you’ve already scoured.\rYou may end up seeing Pokémon\nthat weren’t there before.
{STRVAR 259, 0}, have you visited\nthe Pal Park recently?\rThere still may be Pokémon that are\nrarely seen in Sinnoh.
{STRVAR 259, 0}, have you visited\nthe Pal Park recently?\rThere still may be Pokémon that are\nrarely seen in Sinnoh.
Hm! Your Pokédex is getting closer\nto completion.\rHave you ever considered a career\nas a Pokémon professor?
Hmm... You’ve caught quite the\nimpressive collection of Pokémon.\rYou’ve obviously had to employ many\nmeans to seek them all out.\rKeep an eye out for rustling tall\ngrass and search it thoroughly.
I can only marvel at the diversity\nof Pokémon.\rI’m still very much in awe of\nthem.
Good, good, you’re getting close to\ncompleting the Pokédex.\rI’m looking forward to seeing its\ncompletion.\rWhen that happens, your views about\nPokémon will likely have changed!
Hmm... You are so very close to\ncompleting your Pokédex.\rThink about what’s missing.\nRecall what you’ve overlooked.\rYou’re so close--please finish\nthe Pokédex!
{STRVAR 259, 0}!\nYou’ve finally done it!\rYou’ve finally completed\nthe National Pokédex!\rThis is better than meeting any\nexotic Pokémon for the first time!\rI feel blessed to have become friends\nwith a Trainer like you!\rSincerely, I thank you from the\nbottom of my heart!
