Welcome!\nI don’t get challenged very often!\rThe glory you are now beholding is\nthe Pastoria Gym Leader!\rThat’s right, I’m Crasher Wake!\rMy Pokémon were toughened up by\nstormy white waters!\rThey’ll take everything you can throw\nat them and then pull you under!\rVictory will be ours!\nCome on, let’s get it done!\r
It seems the undertow pulled me\nunder...\rBut I had a great time battling\nwith you!\rYou’ve earned this!\r
{STRVAR 3, 0} received\nthe Fen Badge from Wake!
You need that Fen Badge to use the\nhidden move Defog outside of battle.\rThis is a special reward from me in\nrecognition of your team’s power.\r
That {STRVAR 8, 0} contains the\nmove {STRVAR 6, 1}.\rIt inflicts double the damage on\ntargets with less than half their\fHP left.\rUse it to end battles decisively!
The styles of battling and winning\nare as widely varied as Trainers are.\rDo you want to know how I battle?\nI battle so I can say I had fun at\fthe end, whether I win or lose!
The Gym Leader Wake... Uh, I mean\nCrasher Wake, is a master of\fWater-type Pokémon.\rI’d say you’ve got guts if you try\nto face down Water types with Fire-\for Ground-type Pokémon!\rBut that part I’ll leave up to you!\nGo and have some good battles!
Oh! {STRVAR 3, 0}!\nYou’ve beaten the Gym Leader!\rSo, how was it?\rDid you enjoy your battle against\nWake... I mean Crasher Wake?\rSure, winning is important, but\ndon’t forget to have fun, too!\rI think Wake... I mean Crasher Wake,\nshowed you what I mean by fun.
