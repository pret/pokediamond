Mom: What’s up, dear?\r...\rWow.\nI can’t believe that happened to you.\rAm I ever glad that both you and\n{STRVAR_1 3, 0} are unharmed.\rThe professor you mentioned is\nmost likely Professor Rowan of\fSandgem Town.\rI’ve heard that he is well known for\nhis studies on Pokémon.\rI hear he’s also quite intimidating...\r{STRVAR_1 3, 1}, I think you need to\nvisit him in Sandgem Town.\rYou need to properly explain why you\nhad no choice but to use his Pokémon.\rDon’t worry!\nI’m sure he will understand.\r
Oh, I know!\n{STRVAR_1 3, 0}, put these on.\r

{STRVAR_1 3, 1}’s mom: Excuse me.\nIs my little {STRVAR_1 3, 1} here?\r
Mom: Oh?\nNo, he’s not...\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 1}’s mom: Oh...\nThen, he must have left already...\fWhat to do...\rThat boy shouted about going on an\nadventure, then he bolted.\rHe’s so headstrong and reckless...\nI at least wanted him to take this...\r
Mom: Not to worry, {STRVAR_1 3, 0} will\ndeliver that to him.\r
