Mom: {STRVAR 3, 0}!\r{STRVAR 3, 1} came calling for you\na little while ago.\rI don’t know what it was about, but\nhe said it was an emergency.\r
Mom: You know how impatient\n{STRVAR 3, 0} is.\rHe took off before I could even\nask what it was about.
Mom: Bye-bye, {STRVAR 3, 0}!\nYou take care now!
Mom: But that {STRVAR 3, 0}...\nHe always invites you along.
Mom: Oh, yes!\n{STRVAR 3, 0}!\rDon’t go into the tall grass.\nWild Pokémon might attack you.\rIt would be OK if you had your own\nPokémon, but you don’t, so...
Mom: What is it, dear?\nIsn’t {STRVAR 3, 0} waiting for you?
Mom: What’s up, dear?\r...\rWow.\nI can’t believe that happened to you.\rAm I ever glad that both you and\n{STRVAR 3, 0} are unharmed.\rThe professor you mentioned is\nmost likely Professor Rowan of\fSandgem Town.\rI’ve heard that he is well known for\nhis studies on Pokémon.\rI hear he’s also quite intimidating...\r{STRVAR 3, 1}, I think you need to\nvisit him in Sandgem Town.\rYou need to properly explain why you\nhad no choice but to use his Pokémon.\rDon’t worry!\nI’m sure he will understand.\r
Oh, I know!\n{STRVAR 3, 0}, put these on.\r
{STRVAR 3, 0} received a pair of\n{COLOR 1}Running Shoes{COLOR 0}!
Going to Sandgem Town is like an\nadventure in itself, right?\rWith those Running Shoes, you can\nget to faraway places much faster.\rOK...\nLet me read the instructions...\r“Press the B Button and dash\nabout faster than ever before!\r“Put on the Running Shoes and\nblaze new trails of adventure!”\rWell, isn’t that just nifty!
Mom: I’ll read you the instructions\nfor the Running Shoes...\r“Press the B Button and dash\nabout faster than ever before!\r“Put on the Running Shoes and\nblaze new trails of adventure!”\rWell, isn’t that just nifty!

Mom: Welcome home, {STRVAR 3, 0}.\nAre you and your Pokémon healthy?\rIt’s so late right now...\nTake a quick rest, dear.\r
Mom: What’s up, {STRVAR 3, 0}?\r...\rWow. Professor Rowan asked you\nto do something that big.\rOK, dear, go for it!\nYour mom’s got your back!\rOh, I know! {STRVAR 3, 0}, I’ve got\nsomething that you’ll find useful.\r
That’s a Journal. It keeps a record\nof your daily events.\rCheck it, and you’ll be able to\nremember what you did last.\r
Gee, a journey full of adventure...\nI envy you, kiddo.\rPlus, you’re not alone.\nYou have your Pokémon with you.\fI wish I could go instead!\r
I’m just joking, dear!\nYup, {STRVAR 3, 0}!\rI’ll be all right by myself, so you\ngo and enjoy your adventure!\rWhen you’re exposed to new things,\nand experience new sensations...\fIt makes your mother happy too.\r...But come back sometimes.\rI would like to see the kinds of\nPokémon you’ve caught, dear.\r
{STRVAR 3, 1}’s mom: Excuse me.\nIs my little {STRVAR 3, 1} here?\r
Mom: Oh?\nNo, he’s not...\r
{STRVAR 3, 1}’s mom: Oh...\nThen, he must have left already...\fWhat to do...\rThat boy shouted about going on an\nadventure, then he bolted.\rHe’s so headstrong and reckless...\nI at least wanted him to take this...\r
Mom: Not to worry, {STRVAR 3, 0} will\ndeliver that to him.\r
Won’t you, {STRVAR 3, 0}?\r
{STRVAR 3, 1}’s mom: Oh, really?\nYou’d do that for me?\r{STRVAR 3, 0}, please take this to\n{STRVAR 3, 1} for me.\r
{STRVAR 3, 1}’s mom: Oh, really?\nYou’d do that for me?\r{STRVAR 3, 0}, please take this to\n{STRVAR 3, 1} for me.\r
{STRVAR 3, 1}’s mom: Let me think...\rKnowing my boy, he would probably\nhead straight to Jubilife City...\rOK, please take that to my\n{STRVAR 3, 1}.\r
Mom: Bye-bye, {STRVAR 3, 0}!\nEnjoy your adventure!\r
