Well, well.\rYou’re quite the adorable Trainer,\nbut you’ve also got a spine.\rAhaha!\nI’m Bertha.\rI have a preference for Ground-type\nPokémon.\rWell, would you show this old lady\nhow much you’ve learned?\r
You’re quite something, youngster.\rI like how you and your Pokémon\nearned the win by working as one.\rThat’s what makes you so strong.\rAhahaha! I think that you can\ngo as far as you want.
The Trainer in the next room is a\nmuch more formidable opponent.\rYou really must have your wits\nabout you.\rHowever, I think you can go as far\nas you desire. Ahahaha!
