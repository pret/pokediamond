I’d heard that Team Galactic was\nup to no good.\rBut here in Sunyshore, we’ve never\neven seen any of them around.
A long time ago, there was a boy\nnamed Cyrus who lived here.\rHe seemed to shun others, and he\npreferred the company of machines.\rHe was a brilliant student, I recall.\nI often wonder what became of him.
