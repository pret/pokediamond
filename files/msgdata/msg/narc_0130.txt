I’ve been hiking all around the\nSinnoh region.\rI love planting Berries wherever\nI go.\rI’ll give you a Berry, too.\nPlease plant it somewhere.\r
Planting Berries is good for\nPokémon.\rIt provides them with more things\nto eat in the wild.
My sister gathers Berries every day!\nPlease come visit again!\rWe cook the Berries, too!\nWe mix them up! They’re yummy!
