Hmm... Well, that is fine, as well.\nVisit if you have a change of heart.

That Pokémon can’t learn a move!\nRead the poster! Keh!
Teach a move to an Egg?\nImpossible even for me! Keh!
You’ve not bonded strongly enough\nwith your Pokémon! Keh!
That Pokémon already knows the move\nI’ve offered to teach! Keh!
I should teach Blast Burn to\nyour {STRVAR 0, 0}?
I should teach Hydro Cannon to\nyour {STRVAR 0, 0}?
I should teach Frenzy Plant to\nyour {STRVAR 0, 0}?
{STRVAR 0, 0} learned\n{STRVAR 6, 1}!
{STRVAR 0, 0} is trying to learn\n{STRVAR 6, 1}.\rBut {STRVAR 0, 0} can’t learn more\nthan four moves.\rDelete an older move to make\nroom for {STRVAR 6, 1}?
Is it OK to forget the\nmove {STRVAR 6, 1}?
1, 2, and... ... ... Poof!\r{STRVAR 0, 0} forgot how to\nuse {STRVAR 6, 1}.\rAnd...\n{STRVAR 0, 0} learned {STRVAR 6, 2}.
