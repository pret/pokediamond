Thanks for rescuing me!\nThis is something to show my thanks!\rIt’s the latest model Bicycle!\nYou must take it. I insist!\r
It’s the latest model, so I’ll read\nthe operating manual to you.\r“Press the B Button to shift up\nor down.”\rIn third gear, you can’t go all that\nfast, but it’s easier to control.\rIn fourth gear, it gets harder to\nsteer and stop, but it’s fast!
CLEFAIRY: Pip piih!
The manager’s gone off to the Team\nGalactic building and hasn’t returned.\rI wonder what’s holding him up?
What was Team Galactic trying to do\nwith other people’s Pokémon?
There is a manual on the latest\nmodel Bicycle.\rThird gear for steering.\nFourth gear for all-out speed!\rChange gears with the B Button for\nexhilarating cycling!
There’s a catalog on Bikes...\rMach Bike--a folding Bike built solely\nfor blazing speed!\rAcro Bike--a folding Bike designed for\nstunts like jumps and wheelies!
