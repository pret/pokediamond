{STRVAR 3, 0}: Hey, {STRVAR 3, 1}!\nOver here! This way!\r
{STRVAR 3, 0}: OK, gramps!\nI brought {STRVAR 3, 1} like I said!\rAll right, I’ll be outta here!\r
Rowan: ...\n...\r...\n...\r...\n...\r
{STRVAR 3, 0}: ...OK...\nI get it...\r
Rowan: Hm! Everyone’s here finally.\n{STRVAR 3, 0}, everyone, listen.\rYou may have forgotten already, but\nI study the evolution of Pokémon.\r
But the more I study, the more\nmysteries appear and multiply.\rPokémon that evolve, and those that\ndon’t...\rWhat makes them different from each\nother?\rDo those that are immature as living\nbeings evolve to ones more mature?\rIf so, what do we make of the\nlegendary Pokémon that don’t evolve?\rAre we to assume that the legendary\nPokémon are complete as creatures?\r
This is where you three come in.\rIn the three lakes of Sinnoh, there\nare said to be mirage Pokémon.\rIf we can obtain data on them,\nit may shed some light on how the\fprocess of Pokémon evolution works.\rI need help from each one of you\non this grand undertaking.\rHelp me find these Pokémon that are\nconsidered to be mirages.\r
{STRVAR 3, 0}: What are you saying?\nI didn’t get no Pokédex!\r
Rowan: ...And who was it that bolted\nfrom the lab before I had a chance\fto give you a Pokédex?\rBut that’s water under the bridge!\rSeeing Pokémon with your own eyes\nis important for you in becoming\fa better Trainer, too.\r
Dawn: You can count on me!\nIt will help with my Pokédex, too.\r{STRVAR 3, 0}, you’ll go too,\nwon’t you?\r
Lucas: You bet, Professor!\rThis will add to the Pokédex\ndatabase and help advance your\fresearch.\r
Rowan: Hm! I would have made all of\nyou go regardless... Anyway.\rNow, there are three lakes.\nFortuitously, there are three of you.\rYou should therefore split up and\ninvestigate the lakes individually.\r
Rowan: Dawn, you go to Lake Verity.\r
Dawn: Will do!\r
Rowan: Lucas, you go to Lake Verity.\r
Lucas: Yes, sir!\r
Rowan: {STRVAR 3, 0}, I want you to\ninvestigate Lake Acuity.\rThat would take you almost to\nSnowpoint City.\rThe road there is harsh. I need\na tough Trainer to go.\r
{STRVAR 3, 0}: Uh... Yeah, of course!\nGramps, you know how to call it!\fYou can tell I’m the hotness!\r
Rowan: And that leaves {STRVAR 3, 0}\nwith Lake Valor.\rThe lake is between Veilstone\nand Pastoria, if memory serves...\r
Rowan: ...\n...Has it stopped?\rAre all of you unharmed?\rLet’s go outside, but be careful.\nI’m concerned about the city.\r
Rowan: {STRVAR 3, 1}, hurry along.\nBut beware of aftershocks.\r
Every book contains someone’s\nmemories of various places and times.\rLibraries aren’t just buildings where\nbooks are kept, you know.\rThey’re where different places\nand times are gathered together.
W-was that an earthquake?\nI didn’t imagine it?
Someone’s always checked out the\nbook I want to read...
I’m feeling wobbly...\rEven though the tremor has ended,\nmy knees still feel like jelly...

“Sinnoh Region’s Mythology”\rLong ago, when Sinnoh had just been\nmade, Pokémon and humans led\fseparate lives.\rThat is not to say they did not help\neach other. No, indeed they did.\rThey supplied each other with goods,\nand supported each other.\rA Pokémon proposed to the others\nto always be ready to help humans.\rIt asked that Pokémon be ready to\nappear before humans always.\rThus, to this day, Pokémon appear\nto us if we venture into tall grass.
