I tried deciphering the engravings on\nthe stone tablet.\rApparently, it is for a Trainer to\nengrave their thoughts after growing\fas a person through adventure.\rA Trainer fitting that description\nwould be you.\rThat’s why I’m asking you for your\nhelp.\rYou’ve met many people and Pokémon,\nand experienced many things that\fshaped you into the person you are.\rI want you to sincerely tell me who\naffected you the most.\rTell me, to whom do you most want\nto say your thanks?\r
Hm...\rYou most want to express your\nthanks to {STRVAR 28, 1}?\rYou’re absolutely certain of it?
Oak: ?!\nWhat was that Pokémon?\rIs it somehow connected to\nthe stone tablet?\rHmm... Where did that Pokémon go?\nIts destination is intriguing...
Oak: What’s wrong? You’re not\nsuggesting there’s no one?\rTell me, to whom do you most want\nto say your thanks?\r
The surface is unmarked.\nIt is polished like a mirror.
{STRVAR 28, 1}, to whom I give\nmy thanks.
