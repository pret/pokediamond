Catching Pokémon is best accomplished\nby whittling the target’s HP down as\flow as possible, then tossing a Ball.\rBut a Pokémon caught that way can’t\nbe used in battle right away.\rThat’s where the Heal Ball comes in\nhandy.\rYou can lower the target’s HP bar to\nred, put it to sleep, or paralyze it.\rThe Heal Ball instantly heals whatever\nails the Pokémon it catches!\rThat’s the Pokémon-friendly Heal Ball!\nPlease, do give it a try!
When attempting to catch a Pokémon,\nyou want to cut the target’s HP.\rBut a fleet-footed Pokémon could\nbolt if you take too much time.\rThe Quick Ball is the solution to\nthat dilemma.\rIt’s designed to work best when\nthrown right at the start of battle!\rThe Quick Ball: the perfect gift for\nthe impatient Trainer!
