Oh, my!\nYou’ve met {STRVAR_1 52, 1} Pokémon!\rWonderful! Yes, bravo!\nProfessor Rowan should be delighted!\rHere is something for you!\r
A Pokémon holding an Exp. Share\nwill be given some of the Exp. Points\ffrom battle.\rIt will get Exp. Points even if it\ndidn’t actually battle.\rI would say an Exp. Share is quite\nuseful for raising weak Pokémon.\rAlso, a Pokémon you get in a trade\nmay disobey you if it is too high\fin level.\rDon’t worry, though. It will obey if\nyou have enough Gym Badges.
You’ve met only {STRVAR_1 52, 1} Pokémon?\rHmm...\nYou’ve got to find at least 35.\rIf you can’t, it will be tough to\ncomplete the Sinnoh Pokédex.
