There are eight Gym Leaders in\nthe Sinnoh region.\rThe objective for Trainers is\nto get Gym Badges from them all.
A Gym Leader isn’t just like any\nTrainer you meet.\rI’d take as many Pokémon as possible\nif I were you.
                  
                      
Roark lets us train our Pokémon in\nthe mine.
