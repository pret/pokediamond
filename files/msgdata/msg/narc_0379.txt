Oh, hello!\nRight this way, please!\r
Hello.\nI’m glad to meet you.\rMy name is Teala, and I’m your guide\nto the Pokémon Wi-Fi Club.\rFirst, I need to give you this.\r
That’s your Pal Pad. You may register\nyour friends in it.\rOnce registered, you may link with\nthose friends over Nintendo WFC\rto trade Pokémon, battle,\nand so on.\rWould you like to know more?
You may meet people on the second\nfloor of a Pokémon Center for trades\for Colosseum battles.\rYou may register such people as\nfriends in your Pal Pad.\rYou may also manually register friends\nby entering their Friend Codes into\fyour Pal Pad.\rWould you like me to repeat that?
I hope you enjoy using Nintendo\nWFC!
