I got my PIKACHU through a trade\nfrom somewhere in the world.\rHe grows quickly, his level’s high,\nbut he doesn’t listen to me...\rIt’s not always easy, but he’s still\nmy irreplaceable partner!
PIKACHU: Pikapikapikaaah!
If everyone around the world had\nPokémon...\rThen everyone around the world could\ncommunicate!
