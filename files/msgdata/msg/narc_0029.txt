                                                          
Ooh, your Pokémon are so very\ncharming! How enchanting!\rThey’re so charming I will even hang\na picture of one right beside me!\rI’m only doing this especially for\nyou! Exciting, don’t you think?\rDress up your Pokémon in my boudoir\nand make it a sight to behold!\rI will snap a photo when you’re done.\nYou will do this, won’t you?
Oh, you silly thing...\nWhere’s your sense of adventure?
Ooh, ooh, yes! How nice!\nLet’s not delay!\rShould I explain to you how to dress\nup your Pokémon?
Ooh, choose which Pokémon you want\nto dress up.
Teheheh...\nI hope you will dress it up adorably!\r
You have a Fashion Case, don’t you?\nAh, oui, wonderful!\rJust choose the Accessories and put\nthem on your Pokémon.\rWhen you’re done, I will snap a photo\nand put it up beside me!\rIf you mix your records with others,\nyou can get their photos, too!\rI think it will be much easier if \nyou will just try!
Ooh, nice work!\nLet’s display the photo right away!\fOh, but it needs to have a title!
{STRVAR 28, 0}...\rOoh, yes, yes! I get it now!\nYour aesthetics shine through!
Oh, non, non, non!\nIt will be forlorn without a title.
Oh... You came out without doing\nanything... How disappointing.
If you dress up any Pokémon again,\nthe photo here will be changed.\rWould you like to dress up\na Pokémon, dearie?
                                                      
Ooh, non, non, non! That’s an Egg!\nIt’s too young to be dressing up!\r
I put your photo up right here.\nIt just looks so perfect there!
It’s a photo frame.
They display photos from Trainers\nyou been mixin’ records with, right?\rI hope you collect yerself some good\nphotos of dressed-up Pokémon!
I won a new Backdrop from the\nPokémon Lottery downstairs.
