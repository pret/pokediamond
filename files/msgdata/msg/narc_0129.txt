It’s a pair of binoculars...\nPut $100 in it?
Not enough money...
Tell me I’m not imagining this...\rThe Great Marsh’s Pokémon seem to be\ndifferent from the ones yesterday...
Use a pair of binoculars to look out\nover the Great Marsh.\rYou can see what kinds of Pokémon\ncan be caught, and where they are.
There are shuttle trains in the\nmarsh called Quick Trams.\rYou should take those if you’re going\nto a deeper area in the marsh.
When you’re walking on the bog,\nyou sometimes sink right in...\rI get so flustered trying to get out,\nI have no luck catching anything.
