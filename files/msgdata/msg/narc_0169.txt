You want to challenge Candice?\rSure thing!\nI was waiting for someone tough!\rBut I should tell you, I’m tough\nbecause I know how to focus.\rPokémon, fashion, romance...\nIt’s all about focus!\rI’ll show you just what I mean.\nGet ready to lose!\r
Wow! You’re great!\nYou’ve earned my respect!\rI think your focus and will bowled\nus over totally.\rOh, that’s right!\nI’m supposed to give you this!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0} received\nthe Icicle Badge from Candice.
That Icicle Badge I just gave you?\rBecause you have it, you can use the\nhidden move Rock Climb anytime, even\fwhen you’re not in a battle.\rOh, and take this, too.\r
{STRVAR_1 8, 0} contains the move\n{STRVAR_1 6, 1}.\rIf the user takes damage, the move’s\npower is doubled!\rCan you imagine what sort of focus\nyou’d need to pull it off?
Do you think I should try to act\nmore like an Ice-type Gym Leader?\rLike, do you think I should be more\ncool and distant?\rThat sort of thing I have trouble\nwith.
Hey, there!\nHow’s it going, Champ-to-be?\rDo you see the big snowballs placed\nhere and there?\rYou need to slide on the ice with\nenough momentum to crush them.\rThe Gym Leader is a user of\nIce-type Pokémon.\rMelt her defenses with scorching-\nhot Fire-type moves!\rIt’s all about focus with this Gym.\nBear down and focus!
Oh! {STRVAR_1 3, 0}!\nYou’ve beaten the Gym Leader!\rYou were more focused than her,\nand your Pokémon picked up on it!
