There’s an odd spaceman\nin front of the ruins.\rThere isn’t anything there, but that\nonly seemed to make him get angry.\rHe’s saying he will blow the town\nup with a bomb...\rThe nerve of it all...\rIf only I were younger, I’d punish\nthat spaceman with my Pokémon...
This town is insignificant!\nThere’s nothing of value here.\rIt doesn’t need to exist, so I’ll\nblow it up with a Galactic Bomb!\rIf you try to mess with me, I’ll shut\nyou down with a Pokémon battle.\rSo, what’s it going to be?\nAre you going to mess with me?
You dare to oppose Team Galactic?\rThat means you’re taking on the\nworld... No, the universe, even!\r
That’s right! Very smart!\nYou know what’s good for you!\rTeam Galactic has come out to the\nboonies like this for everyone’s sake.\rYour cooperation is appreciated.\nNow, where is my partner...?
Too much to handle...\nI can’t do anything here...\rThis place is nothing!\nI’ll be happily rid of this place!\r
Oh, you were magnificent!\nAren’t you quite the Trainer?\rAs the elder of Celestic Town, I give\nyou my thanks.\rOh? That Old Charm...\nMay I see that, dear?\r...\nWhat’s that?\rYou say Cynthia entrusted you with\nit to deliver to me?\rThat Cynthia...\nShe’s my granddaughter.\r
{STRVAR 3, 0} handed over\nthe {STRVAR 8, 1} to the elder.
This Old Charm is something made in\nCelestic Town long, long ago.\rIt was made in honor of a mythical\ndeity said to have created Sinnoh.\rThese Old Charms are still discovered\nnow and again.\rSince you’re in Celestic Town, why not\nlook around inside the ruins?
You’ve gone to the trouble\nof visiting Celestic Town.\rWhy not take a little more time\nto examine the ruins?
There appears to have been\nan insignificant struggle here.\rEveryone should step back and view\nthings from a bigger perspective.\rYes, a bigger perspective, one that\nis on a universal scale.\r
My name is Cyrus.\rI seek the power to create a new\nworld, a world without strife.\rHowever, that power seems to be\nunavailable here...\rWe’ve met before, yes?\nIt was at Mt. Coronet.\rIf you discover any power derived\nfrom the legends of Sinnoh, inform me.\rFor that power is what I need to\ncreate my new world.\r
Howdy!\nStudying up on local history?
Hey, do you know what they say?\rThey say a Pokémon created the\nSinnoh region.
There’s no Pokémon Mart in this\ntown...\rInstead, you can buy and sell items\nin this house here.
