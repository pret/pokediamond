Mom: Oh, I don’t know about that.\rI’ve never spoken to {STRVAR 259, 0}\nabout Contests.\rI’m surprised you two know each\nother, though.\r

OK, Johanna, I’ll see you!\r

You’re going to enter Contests?\nBut I don’t see a Poffin Case.\rIt could be tough for you to win\nContests without it.\rBut if you’re determined to enter,\ndon’t let me stop you.\rIt wouldn’t hurt to get in some\npractice at the counter on the right.\r
You’re going to enter Contests?\nAnd, yup, you have a Poffin Case.\rLet me gift you with this fabulously\nwonderful Poffin!\r
