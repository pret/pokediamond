Oh, is that a Pokédex?\nYou must be helping Professor Rowan?\rWhat’s your name?\r...\rOK, hello, {STRVAR_1 3, 0}.\nI’ll be sure to remember that name!\rMy name is Cynthia.\nI’m a Trainer just like you.\rI’ve been studying Pokémon mythology\nlately, just out of curiosity.\r
Here in Eterna City, there is a\nstatue of an ancient Pokémon.\rAccording to myth, it was an\nextremely powerful Pokémon.\rWho knows? You may encounter\nsomething like it while you’re\ftraveling with your Pokédex.\rTry using this.\nIt should help you on your way.\r
Cynthia: Remember, the hidden move\nCut can be used in the field.\rIt will let you go places that were\npreviously inaccessible to you.\rThat’s important for filling up your\nPokédex, right?\rThen luck be with you, young Trainer!\r
Hey! You there, kid!\nStay away from that Pokémon statue!\rTeam Galactic is conducting an\nofficial investigation here!
Hey, you! Yeah, you, Trainer!\rErrr...\nIt’s OK. Never mind. You look tough.\rI won’t take... Um, I’ll just let you\nkeep your Pokémon. Carry on!
Have you seen our building?\rTeam Galactic is so stinking rich\nthat we can have one built instantly!
Since that Team Galactic building went\nup, the city’s atmosphere has gotten\fall creepy and tense.\rI don’t know what those people are\ndoing up in that place...
With Team Galactic gone, what’s going\nto happen to their building?
My friend said Team Galactic took his\nfavorite Pokémon away.\rI don’t think he’s telling the truth.\nTeam Galactic looks so cool.\fThey don’t look like common thugs.
Do you use Bike stands?\rIt looks so cool to hop off your Bike\nand then lean on it. It looks so smooth!
If you’re visiting Eterna, you need to\nget yourself a Bicycle and take a\fride down the Cycling Road.
                                                                 
They say this is an old city.\rIt doesn’t look it, though.\nNot with all these tall buildings.
Eterna City’s not anything like it\nwas before, way back in the day.
They say this is a Pokémon that lived\nlong, long ago.
Oh, don’t tell me you don’t have\nan Explorer Kit?\rYou should have a word with the man\nnext door to the Pokémon Center.\r

Going underground with the Explorer\nKit is a blast, isn’t it?
Oh, wow!\nYou got a Bicycle!\rYou can ride down Cycling Road\nand end up in Hearthome City.\rIt’s a fast and fun ride.\nYou should check it out!\r

It feels great riding a Bike with the\nwind in your face, doesn’t it?
