All my grandchildren are clamoring\nfor Pokémon of their own.\rIt may be tricky to manage it, but\nit will brighten up the mood more.
Oh, no, there are no stairs in\nthis house. It’s easier that way.\rThe lack of stairs makes it easy for\nthe little Pokémon to get about.
A world in which people are\ncompassionate to others...\rThat’s all that matters to me.
Hearthome is a kid-friendly city,\nthey say, but I disagree.\rHearthome is friendly to kids,\ngrown-ups, and Pokémon too.
