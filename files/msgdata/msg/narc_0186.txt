The Battle Tower is the building\nat the back of the Battle Park.\rThe tower has four sets of Battle\nRooms for different kinds of battles.\rThe Single Battle Rooms are for\nconducting one-on-one battles.\rThe Double Battle Rooms are for\ntwo-on-two battles.\rThe Multi Battle Rooms are for\ntag team battles with a partner.\rThe Wi-Fi Battle Rooms are for\nbattling other Trainers from around\fthe world.\r
Welcome to the Battle Park!\rI can explain how the Point Card and\nthe BP (Battle Points) work.\r
What would you like me to explain?
