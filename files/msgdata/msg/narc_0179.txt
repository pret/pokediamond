Ah, you timed your arrival well.\rI’ve just finished reading a book,\nyou see.\rAllow me to introduce myself.\rI am Lucian.\nI am a user of the Psychic type.\rI must say, you’ve already proven\nyourself to be outstanding\fby coming this far.\rThey say I am the toughest of the\nElite Four.\rI’m afraid I will have to go all out\nagainst you to live up to that\freputation.\r
Congratulations.\nYou’ve now beaten the Elite Four.\rHowever, that doesn’t mean you’re\ndone with the Pokémon League.\rThere remains the Champion.\rI should warn you--the Champion is\nfar stronger than the Elite Four.\rNow, go on. Step through the\ndoorway to your final battle.
I’ll be reading books until the next\nchallenger arrives.\rThat will calm my nerves, so that\nI may deal with all situations without\fpanicking.
