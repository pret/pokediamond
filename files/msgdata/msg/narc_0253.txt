I’m Mira...\rI was catching Pokémon, and then\nI got lost...\rI’m so scared...\rPlease!\nPlease take me to the exit!\r
{STRVAR 259, 0} decided to go with\nMira!
Mira: I’ll keep your Pokémon healthy\nall the time!
Trainer, your name is {STRVAR 259, 0}?\rMy name is Mira.\nI like your name!\r
Mira: Oh! {STRVAR 259, 0}...\nI waited... A long time...\r
Mira: Oh! There’s the exit!\rI want to get tougher so I\nwon’t be such a scaredy-cat.\r{STRVAR 259, 0}, bye-bye!\nThank you!\r
                             
                             
                          
Mira: I like helpful Pokémon moves\nlike Growl and Minimize.\rThose kinds of moves are my\nfavorites.
Mira: This cave...\nIt’s so easy to get confused.\rDo you know where we are?
