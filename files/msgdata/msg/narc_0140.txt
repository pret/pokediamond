Welcome to the fabulous Veilstone\nDepartment Store.
This department store knows how to\nensure customer satisfaction.\rThey really look after you once you\nbecome a regular customer.
I like the formal air of a luxury\ndepartment store.
I made an Accessory modeled after\nthe Pokémon of a Trainer I met.\rWould you like one?\r
It’s a {STRVAR 31, 0}.\rIt will give your Pokémon a\ndifferent look for Contests.
