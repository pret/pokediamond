...Pant...pant...\r...Why am I running like this\nanyway?!\rThat new universe that the boss\nwas talking about...\rIt’s giving me goose bumps thinking\nabout it... So, we use this...\r
Gweh! You were eavesdropping!\nI was only talking to myself!\rYou’re persistent, too...\nI’m pooped out from all the running...\rBut, I’m not...\nGoing to battle you...\r
Aww, no...\nYou’re still on my tail...?\fThe lake’s within sight...\rYou leave me no choice...\nMy Pokémon will KO you...\r
I can’t battle anymore...\nI’m running on fumes...\rI’ll have to give this to the\nCommander...\rI wish...\nI got to use it at the lake...\r
Cynthia: Oh, hello, long time no see!\nHow is your Pokédex filling up?\rI came to research the folklore\nabout the lake, but...\rWell, it doesn’t appear as if the\nlake is open to the public now.\rHave you heard the folklore about it?\rThey say there is an island inside\nthe lake.\rAnd inside that island is a mirage\nof a Pokémon.\rNo one must enter the chamber\nof that Pokémon...\rSorry to change the subject, but\nhave you seen the group of PSYDUCK\fon Route 210?
Cynthia: Yes, that’s right.\nBy the cafe on Route 210.\rYou’ve seen that group of PSYDUCK\nhuddled with their heads in their,\fuh, hands...?\r
Cynthia: You haven’t seen them?\nBy the cafe on Route 210.\rThere’s a group of PSYDUCK huddled\nwith their heads in their, uh,\fhands...?\r
Anyway, what you should do is use\nthis medicine on the PSYDUCK.\rYou’re working on a Pokédex, so it\nwould be worthwhile for you.\r
Cynthia: I went on a big adventure\nwith a Pokédex when I was younger.\rI hope you get to meet every kind\nof Pokémon there is to see.\rIt may help you with the secret of\nthe mirage Pokémon.\rSee you later!\r
We’ve been asked to keep everyone\nout of the lake area.\rReason? I’m not too sure, but\napparently to protect the lake.
To protect the lake...\rIt’s nice to know there are still\npeople worth admiring like that.\rI believe his name was Cyrus?
Stop, stop!\nYes, you!\rSunyshore City, which is down this\nroad, had a major blackout!\rCrews are working on restoring\npower, but the road’s closed now.\r

What am I to do...?\rI’ve gone and dropped my Suite\nKey somewhere again...\rThe hotel people won’t be happy with\nme...\rI’m sure I had it when I left the\nreception counter earlier...
What am I to do...?\rI’ve gone and dropped my Suite\nKey somewhere again...\rOh!\nThat’s my Suite Key!\rYou found it for me?\nOh, that’s sweet of you! Thank you!\r
