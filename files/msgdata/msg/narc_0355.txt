At our restaurant, you can enjoy\nmore than just exquisite dining.\rYou may also partake in battles.\nBon appetit!
I am so sorry.\nWe are now closed.\fPlease do visit while we are open.\r
Before we make our toast, I’d hoped\nfor a battle...\rHowever, you seem to be short\na Pokémon for that.
If you want to have a battle with us,\nyou’ll need to bring more Pokémon.
With someone as beautiful as you for\nmy model, I am sure to paint\fa masterpiece!\r
What is it?\nDo you wish for a battle?\r
                                               
Though we lost our battle...\nA toast to your beauty, that no\fpainting could ever hope to capture!
He said he’d treat me to a dinner\nhere if I agreed to model for him.\rSo, I came along, but I haven’t\nmade up my mind yet.\r
When I can’t decide, I battle\nto make the decision!\r
                                                           
I’ve decided to model for him.\nThat’s given me an appetite!
There is no price too high for the\nsake of my art...\rThat said, my oh my, these meals\nlook awfully pricey...\r
What is it?\nAre you feeling hungry, too?\rOh, I see, that’s not it!\nYou wanted a battle!\r
                                           
My hors d’oeuvres have gone cold...
I have to slow down on eating these\ndelicious hors d’oeuvres.\rI don’t want to be all bloated by\nthe time the main dish comes.\r
I’d like a light battle to work up\nmy appetite.\rWould you care to join us?\r
                                                                  
The hors d’oeuvres haven’t grown\ncold...\rThese are supposed to be served\nchilled!
The worth of a meal isn’t determined\nmerely by its flavor.\rPresentation, that is, color and\nplacement, is vital.\rIn other words, a fine meal can be\nlikened to the finest work of art...\r
And in Pokémon battles, I also hope\nto see beauty.\rYou do agree with me, yes?\r
                                                                                                 
The meals prepared here are not\nmerely tasty, they are also healthy.\rDiners need not worry about ruining\ntheir figures eating here.
Today’s main dish is scrumptiously\ndelicious!\rIf I can keep eating this food,\nI’ll model anytime I can!\r
I feel guilty just eating all\nthis delicious food like this.\rI’ll join in the battle, too!\r
                                                              
The models of great paintings were\noften rather plump.\rThat means I can keep eating without\nobsessing over my figure!
If you want to challenge us, bring\nsome more Pokémon.
If you want to battle us, you have\nto have at least two Pokémon!
Actually, my father happens to be\nthe chef here.\r
What is it? A battle?\nBahaha... You think you can beat me?\r
                           
We’ve lost, but let’s make a toast\nto our future together anyway!
Oh, my!\nYour father is the chef here?\rHow wonderful!\r
I haven’t told him, but my father\nowns the hotel and restaurant...\rOh, but that’s beside the point.\nWould you care for a battle?\r
                                           
Let’s make a toast to the prosperity\nof the restaurant!
I have to hand it to my father--\nthese hors d’oeuvres are delicious!\r
...Are you maybe asking me for\na battle?\rWell, certainly!\nI never back down from a challenge!\r
                            
Finally. Now we can go about enjoying\nour meal without disruption.
Yes! This meal is good enough to\nserve at the hotel.\r
Please don’t tell my date that my\nfather owns the restaurant.\rI’ll have a battle with you if you\nkeep your mouth shut.
                            
My date did his best, but you were\nbetter than the both of us.
Fufufu, my date’s really enjoying\nmy dad’s cooking.\rShe has a dreamy expression after\nevery bite!\r
I’m feeling great!\nSure, I’ll have a battle with you.\rThat’s why you approached us, right?\r
                                 
My prowess as a Trainer isn’t up to\nsnuff...\rIt’s not like my father’s scrumptious\ncooking...
This succulent flavor!\nIt reminds me of a world trip I took.\rMy father and I traveled everywhere\ndining at only the best restaurants.\r
Eating this fabulous meal has\nreally lifted my spirits.\rJoin us for a battle?\r
                                                        
Your father’s cooking has a very\nmagical quality to it.\rIt seems to perk people up with\nenergy.
If your intention is to test your\nskill on us, I daresay you ought to\fbring at least another Pokémon.
Oh, you’re offering to do battle\nwith us? How nice of you.\rUnfortunately, you simply cannot\nbattle us both with just one Pokémon.
Let me propose a toast to many\nmore happy years together.\r
Since I took my retirement, I’ve been\ntraveling with my wife.\rWe both enjoy searching for delicious\ndining experiences.\rYou seem to enjoy battling with\nPokémon. Am I right?\r
                               
Well, so much for that. Let’s try to\nenjoy the rest of our meal.
To our health, welfare, and to fine\ndining! Cheers!\r
A toast before a meal helps stimulate\nthe appetite, I find.\rBut that’s neither here nor there.\nYou wanted a battle, surely?
                        
Gourmet dining in restaurants and\nexhilarating Pokémon battles...\rThere is so much contentment in my\nlife!
Hmm!\nNow, this is special!\rIt appears as if it were only grazed\nwith fire, but in reality, much\fcare has gone into its preparation!\r
When you get to be an accomplished\ngourmet like myself, one can tell at\fa glance if a dish is delicious or not.\rYou would battle against such\na discerning gourmet?\r
                                                    
Well, so much for that.\rWe’ll keep a stiff upper lip and look\nforward to enjoying the main course.
These hors d’oeuvres are simply\ndivine!\rThey tell me that I can expect the\nmain course to be fantastic!\r
I thought the main course arrived\nalready...\rYou’re a Trainer seeking battle?\r
                                                
The hors d’oeuvres were most\nexcellent!
Hmm!\nThe chef flambeed this to perfection!\rThe rich aromas and flavors fill my\nmouth with joy!\r
You’re throwing down a challenge\nin the middle of our meal?\rI would say you’re a very dedicated\nTrainer, especially for one so young!\r
                                                      
Ah... I’m very satisfied with our\nmeal and our battle.
...!\nThis sauce!\rIt’s a spicy sauce in Hoenn style\nmade from grated Cheri Berries!\r
Would you like to sample a bite?\r...\nOh, right. Pokémon?\r
                                              
Battling is fine, of course.\rBut for me, I would rather be out\nenjoying good meals.
If you want to battle us, you\nhave to have two Pokémon.
Don’t you have two Pokémon?\nWe’ll have to battle another time!
Alison, um, I, er...\nThank you for coming today...\rShould we make a toast?\r
She’s the girl from the Pokémon-\ngoods shop I go to all the time.\rWe’re incredibly happy together.\nWould you like to battle us?\r
                                                   
Oh, no, I’m sorry we lost.\nAlison, you’re not upset?
Fufu... Eugene, you act so different\nfrom the way you do at the shop.\rYou’re surprisingly shy.\r
I work at a Pokémon-goods shop\nbecause I love Pokémon.\rThe job lets me be with Pokémon\nall day long.\rIt naturally made me pretty decent\nat battling. Want to try me?\r
                                             
I don’t worry much about winning\nor losing.\rI keep my Pokémon with me because\nI love them!
If my Pokémon buddies hear I went\non a date with you, Alison...\rThey’re probably going to hate me\nfor it...\r
Are you Alison’s fan, too?
                                             
Alison, seeing your smiling face...\rI can’t tell if these appetizers\nare delicious or not!
Sorry? What? Date?\rUm... Eugene...\nYou are a valued customer and all...\r
...Even though I said that, I admit\nthe invitation was flattering.\rSo I accepted his invitation.\rI’ll let my Pokémon decide for my\nfickle heart. Let’s battle?\r
                                            
You know, it is true what they say.\nThere is no evil among Pokémon fans!\rThat goes for you and Eugene!
Looks like our main course is here.\nPlease, enjoy yourself.\rI’ve got the bill covered today!\r
I’ll defeat you and collect the\nprize money!\r
                                                         
My wallet’s empty after paying the\nprize money...\rOh, no, it’s OK! No need to worry!\nI still have my secret stash of cash!
Eugene, I think you’re a little\nawkward, but you’re very earnest.\r
If I team up with my date, it could\nbe an interesting combination.\rI think we could battle in an\nintriguing manner. Do you?\r
                                 
The meal was delicious, and our battle\nwas so much fun.\rI really insist that we split the bill.
If you have two Pokémon, I’ll take\nyou on with my mom.
I’m willing to have a battle with\nmy son, my pride and joy.\rBut you must bring more Pokémon\nthan that.
What should I have today?\nJuice, ice cream, cake, and, and...\r
Oh, hi, Trainer!\rWant to battle Pokémon with us\nbefore we have a yummy dinner?\r
                                         
I don’t get it. Grown-ups always have\na toast before eating.\rWhat’s that for?\nAnd I don’t see any bread?
My dear, Mommy is so proud of you\nfor doing so well on your test.\rYou may order anything you like.\nIt’s your reward, dearest!\r
Did you know? My boy is not only a\ngenius at school, but he’s also\fa Pokémon prodigy!\rWould you like to challenge us and\nsee?\r
                                               
I wish to propose a toast.\rMay my darling Esteban get another\n100% on a test!
Wow, they bring out things one dish\nat a time!\rIt’s not like how it is at home!\r
I do my homework while eating.\nI can battle anytime!\r
                                               
We’re going to eat this delicious\nstuff now. Bye-bye!
This restaurant is the talk of the\ntown for the delicious food.\r
I beg your pardon?\nYou want a battle now?\rWell, that’s all right.\nIt’s not as if I dislike it.\r
                                 
Thank you for letting my dear son\nexperience an invaluable lesson.
Do mothers and fathers go off to\neat like this?\rI mean without taking their kids\nalong.\r
But that’s OK.\rIt’s way more fun for me to battle\nthan go eat fancy dinners!\r
                                                  
Mom, you gotta make me this at home!
This is a special occasion, Esteban.\rThis is to celebrate your great\ngrades!\r
Oh? A battle, you say?\nWell, certainly. Why not?\r
                                               
Is the dessert coming soon?
My daughter and I always battle\ntogether, none of that one-on-one.
I can go against you with Papa.\nPlease bring more Pokémon.
Here’s a toast for Mom.\nMay she always be healthy!\r
My wife’s in the hospital waiting for\nthe baby to arrive.\rSince I can’t cook, I came here with\nmy daughter.\rHow would you like a battle with\nus before we eat?\r
                         
The house will be a lot noisier when\nthe baby comes home with Mommy.
I wonder what Mommy will bring home?\nA baby boy? A baby girl?\r
A boy will be a brother, and a girl\nwill be a sister.\rI’m going to be the older sister,\nso I should get better at Pokémon!\r
                            
Little babies cry like Pokémon!\nPiyaaaah!
Wow... Look at these appetizers.\nThis is just so extravagant.\r
I’m no cook, I’ll admit that freely.\rBut battling Pokémon... There’s\nsomething I’m comfortable with.\r
                            
Let’s get over the sting of this loss\nby enjoying this delicious meal!
Wow!\nThis food looks really fancy!\r
Papa is a rotten cook, so we can\ngo out and eat good food like this!\rDid you come to this restaurant to\nbattle Pokémon?\r
               
I’ve never eaten anything like this\nbefore.
Here’s the main dish!\r
What is it?\nDid you want to battle with us?\r
              
Jocelyn, I hope the new baby will be\nas kindhearted as you.
I wish Mommy were here to eat with\nus...\r
Mommy gave me my Pokémon.\nWant to see how tough they are?\r
                            
Next time, let’s come with everyone.\nThe baby, too!
Yeah? What’s up?\nDid you want to be on TV, too?\rOh, right, sorry!\nYou wanted to battle!\rYou’ll be battling the two of us.\nYou need at least two Pokémon.
If you want an autograph, you’ll\nhave to wait till we finish filming.\rOh, and if you want to battle,\nbring two Pokémon, OK?
Let’s start with a shot of the\ndrinks as a camera test.\r
Hunh? You’re inviting us to battle at\na time like this?\r
                                          
Oh, man...\nOur drinks are lukewarm now.
Today’s featured drink is freshly\nsqueezed juice made from ripened\fPecha Berries picked this morning!\r
Pardon?\nPokémon?\rOK, a quick one before we do any\nfilming for the show.\r
                                             
Do you think we should rehearse this\none more time?\rToday’s featured drink is freshly\nsqueezed...
Hey, these appetizers sure do look\ndelicious.\rWill someone bring me a mist spray\nso they look even fresher?\r
Thanks, that was quick!\r...Wait, where’s the mist spray?\nOh, you want a battle?\rWhatever, then.\nI’m up for your challenge!\r
                                                             
Photographing food isn’t easy.\nIt’s actually very technical.
These look fabulous, too.\nWe need the camera to zoom in more!\r
Please don’t talk to me while we’re\nfilming!\rOh, actually, hold on.\rA Trainer barges in on our fine\ndining experience...\rI like that!\nIt adds drama to our story!\r
                               
Darling Darryl, are you ready?\rWhen I take a bite, I want\na close-up of my lips, all right?
Whoa...\nSo this is the main dish? Yowza!\rLet’s get this filming done quick\nso I can chow down, too!\r
You’ve been sniffing around a lot...\nAre you messing with our filming?\r
                                          
Oh, no... Everything’s gone cold while\nwe were battling...
Chomp!\rMmm... This is...\nLight, and yet rich flavored...\fIt delectably melts away...\fA hint of an aftertaste, yet crisp...\fNeither too sweet nor too bitter...\fMy words can’t do this justice!\r
It’s not easy trying to describe\nfood while you’re eating.\rBut I can battle anytime during\nfilming!\r
                                                                                                   
Do you know what the most important\nthing is for gourmet reporting?\rIt’s a...thesauruslike vocabulary!
I’ll only say this once, so listen\nclosely. I’ll even say it slowly.\rTo battle against two Trainers, you\nneed two or more Pokémon.\rNow if you were to bring more\nPokémon, I could consider a battle...
Oh, you’ll have to bring more Pokémon\nthan that to battle us!
And another brilliant day on the\nmarkets! A toast to my Lady Luck!\r
Since I’ve been with her, I’ve been\nriding a hot streak on the markets.\rI’m surfing on a wave of good luck!\nYou’re sure you want to battle us?\r
                            
This is just a minor setback.\nI can easily make up for this!
Ooh! All your stocks went up again?\nYou haven’t guessed wrong yet!\r
My boyfriend’s a stock market\nwizard!\rDid you know? Someone that lucky also\nhappens to make a tough Trainer.\rAre you willing to try your luck\nagainst that?\r
                          
It’s just one loss. We can make that\nback with a big win next time!
There’s no need for technique.\rYou just have to read what’s in your\nopponent’s heart.\r
When I say “heart,” I don’t mean\nwhat that person’s thinking. It’s\fabout how they want to be perceived.\rDo you... Would you like me to think\nof you as a tough Trainer?\r
                               
I had a bad feeling about this\nTrainer...
No, really? Ooeeeh! That is so neat!\nHow can you tell these things?\r
My boyfriend could tell that deep\ndown, I’m actually a frightened and\flonely child!\rI don’t think I could ever lose with\nhim. Want to try?\r
                            
It’s amazing that you predicted you\nwould lose!
Let’s savor this extravagant meal\nand think of what it represents.\rWe can use that as motivation to\nkeep winning at life!\r
Personally, I think there are two\nkinds of people.\rThose who face up to challenges\nand those who duck and cover.\rYou’re the type who accepts\nchallenges, am I right?\r
                                        
If I had the power of premonition,\nI’d be a terror on the markets.\rBut you know that’s not really\npossible.
How can you guess right about\neverything all the time?\rDo you really have the power of\npremonition?\r
I’m convinced that he has some\nextrasensory power or something.\rI’m teaming up with a guy like that.\nAre you sure you want to do this?\r
                                         
If it’s not premonition, did you...\nMaybe come from the future?
One Pokémon is insufficient if you\nwant to battle against us.
If you’d bring two or more Pokémon,\nwe could have a battle with you.
Hmm... This beverage’s coloration\nborders on the positively toxic...\rHowever, my analysis indicates that it\nis composed of natural ingredients.\r
What is it?\nYou are?\r...\n...Oh, yes, a Trainer.\r
                                                               
The results of that battle are\ninsignificant. Let’s drink up.
Oh, dear!\nI wish you wouldn’t!\rWe’re at a fancy restaurant, and you\nwant to analyze what’s served?\r
Oh, you’re a Trainer?\r
                                                        
Cheers, dear!\rPlease don’t start analyzing what\nwe just drank!
Interesting...\nThese hors d’oeuvres are fascinating.\rPlant fiber 20%, iron 5%, protein 35%.\nCurious and curiouser...\r
What is it now? Do you want me to\nanalyze your skill level?\r
                                                             
I feel compelled to analyze that\nwhich is unknown to me.\rBy defining its composition, I feel\nreassured in my knowledge.
Oh, dear, must you go on that way?\nIt takes the magic out of a meal.\rI wish you wouldn’t think about your\nresearch while we’re out eating!\r
My husband never ceases to amaze\nme with his dedication to research.\rWould you care to have a battle\nwith us?\r
                                                      
If you were to ask me, I would\nrather not know about what I don’t\funderstand. It’s simpler that way.
By my calculations, the main dish\nshould have arrived by now.\rPerhaps the thermal setting is too\nlow to prepare the food efficiently?\r
You there!\nLet’s battle to consume time!\r
                                                            
They brought the main course while\nwe were battling...\rThe calorie content appears to be\nalarmingly high.
There isn’t any point getting\nimpatient over the food, dear.\rIsn’t this the sort of situation\nthat you brought your Pokémon for?\r
Oh, what good timing!\rWould you join us for a quick\nbattle?\r
                                                       
Oh, dear, if we take in too many\ncalories, we can always work them off\fby battling!
