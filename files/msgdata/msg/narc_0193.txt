Welcome! Thanks for joining our\npractice Contest!\rFeel free to practice all you want\nand train for the big show!\rI’ll be taking part to practice up\non being an MC!\r
Looks like everyone’s here, so let’s\nget on with our dance practice!\r{STRVAR_1 1, 0}, you need to dance just\nlike the main dancer.\rAfter dancing twice, the main dancer\nswitches with a backup dancer.\rYou get to be the main dancer last.\nDo a dance that no one can imitate!\rOK! Start it up!\r
