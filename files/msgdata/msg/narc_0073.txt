Have you ever seen or heard about\ndifferently colored Pokémon?\rFor instance, a regular PIKACHU has\na yellow body, correct?\rWell, the different-colored PIKACHU\nhas a sort of orange body.
You know how Pokémon have different\nnatures like we have personalities?\rI don’t think it’s surprising to see\nPokémon in different colors.
PIKACHU: Pikaaah!
