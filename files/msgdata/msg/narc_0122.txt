And there do I see my father.\nMy son. My life.\rAnd there do I see nature.\nPokémon. The world.
The art of crafting things fatigues\none’s spirit.\rWhen the spirit is healed, the desire\nto make something returns.\rIt is such a wondrous cycle.
When people and Pokémon join hands,\neveryone’s happy.\rIt makes everyone come together.\nIt could even make the world one!
That people are lonely is only natural.\nIt gives me compassion for others.\rIt’s what makes me look forward to\na better tomorrow.\rBut there are still moments of\nfondness for the past.\fThough, time can heal some sadness...
There are still words that not everyone\ncan describe...\fThe words are “love” and “joy.”
Pokémon... People... It’s only natural\nthat we are all so very different.\rMake sure that you never judge\na Pokémon on if it’s weak or strong.\rYou must always look for the good\ninside of them. That’s what counts!
