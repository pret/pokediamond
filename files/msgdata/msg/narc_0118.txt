Good for you!\rYou’ll be using my Boxes like crazy\nif you’re using that now.\rWell, I always thought a good Trainer\nought to juggle Boxes smartly, though\fI shouldn’t be the one to say so.\rOh yeah, do you want a Pokémon named\nEEVEE?
Bebe: So, do you want that EEVEE\nthat I’ve got?

Would you like to give a nickname\nto the EEVEE that Bebe gave you?
