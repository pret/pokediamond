...You are?\rOK, you’re {STRVAR 259, 1, 0}.\nI’m Riley.\rI’m a Trainer, and yes, it is a bit\nodd that I would be training here.\rIf you’d like, we could team up.\nThe wild Pokémon here are restless.\r
{STRVAR 259, 1, 0} decided to go with\nRiley!
Riley: If your Pokémon get hurt,\nI’ll heal them up.
Riley: Hi, {STRVAR 259, 1, 0}.\nLet’s team up.\fThe Pokémon seem to be restless.\r
Riley: ...Are you going back?\rI’ll be hanging around here.\nIt would be good if you came back.\r
Riley: I get it now. You’re\nresponsible for agitating the Pokémon.\rI don’t care what good reason you\nmay have, but I don’t want you\fbringing any trouble into my mine.\r
Grunt 1: We’re Team Galactic!\nWe’ll take all the Pokémon we want!\fIsn’t that right, partner?\r
Grunt 2: You said it, brother!\nSo that’s what we’re gonna do!\rWe’re abducting all the Pokémon from\nthis rusted-out Iron Island!\r
Riley: To share in all the joys and\nall the sorrows...\rThat is how all the Trainers and\nPokémon live in Sinnoh!\rI won’t allow anyone to defy that\ncode of ethics!\rCome on, {STRVAR 259, 1, 0}!\nThis is one battle we can’t lose!\r
Grunt 1: Stop! I said stop!\nYour combination is so sick!\fThe both of you, and your Pokémon...\rLet’s beat it, partner!\r
Grunt 2: You said it, brother!\rWe don’t even know what Team \nGalactic’s big plan is anyway!\r
Riley: Thanks.\nYou really helped me out.\rListen, I have a Pokémon Egg\nhere.\rWould you take it with you?
Riley: Thanks!\rI’d like you to show the Pokémon\nthat’s inside the Egg all sorts\fof new places.\r
Riley: Thank you...\rBut you don’t have room to take\nanother Pokémon.\rAll right, then.\nI’ll wait here for you.
Riley: I hope you’ll accept it as\na token of our friendship.\r
Riley: Spending time with you was\nvery enjoyable.\rI intend to test my skills in other\nplaces from now on.\rLet’s meet again!\nTake care on the way out.
                              
                                 
Riley: Haha, I’d have to agree.\rPeople training here would be those\nwith too much time on their hands.
Riley: This used to be a fairly\nthriving ore mine once upon a time.\rI guess the steel ore’s played out.\nThere’s only Pokémon here now.
Riley: Have you met Byron?\nThe Leader of Canalave Gym?\rHe’s asked me to become a Gym Leader,\nbut there’s his son Roark to consider.
Riley: Imagine what it would be like\nfor a Steel-type Pokémon user to\fbattle a Steel type.\rWould that be like battling yourself,\nI wonder?\rI mean, it’s a lot harder to defeat\none’s self than anyone else.
Riley: What’s going on here, though?\nThe native Pokémon are restless...\rI don’t like this...\nLet’s hurry.
