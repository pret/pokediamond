We, Team Galactic, are conducting\nresearch in the Eterna Forest!\rThis is as far as you will go!\r
Our research involves catching\nPokémon in the flowery meadows of\fFloaroma Town.\rWe are also using the energy of the\nValley Windworks for something.\rBut that is of no concern to you!\r

Many Poison-type Pokémon make the\nEterna Forest their home.\rBut I didn’t buy any Antidotes.\nWhat should I do?\fDo I press on, or do I go back?
