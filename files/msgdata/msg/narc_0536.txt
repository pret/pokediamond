I wasnâ€™t experienced enough for\nthe Battle Tower...\rTraining on Stark Mountain seems to\nbe the only sensible choice ...\rFor some reason, the best Trainers\nin Sinnoh seem to gather there.
In a Multi Battle, coordination with\nyour partner is vital.\rBy working together, one plus one\ncould become not just two, but even\fthree or four.\rBut one times one is always one.\nDo you understand that?
Some say the universe was made by\nsomething born from an Egg...\rA man I met long ago told me that.
