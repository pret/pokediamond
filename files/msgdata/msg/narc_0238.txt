Grunt 1: Enough arguing!\nHand over that sweet Honey!\r
Grunt 2: Do as we say!\nTeam Galactic will have that Honey!\rWe must have it to attract Pokémon\nin great numbers!\r
Grunt 1: Hey! This kid is a witness!\nWhat’ll we do?\r
Grunt 2: We don’t need the brat\nrunning off to get help...\rThe solution’s simple!\nWe ensure the brat stays quiet!\r
Grunt 1: This is so lame...\nThey’re going to dock my pay!\r
Grunt 2: I’m up next!\nHeheheh...\rBattling you right after my cohort\nweakened you gives me the edge!\r
Grunt 1: This brat’s tough!\nLike, really, really tough!\rTougher than I can put into words,\nand I know a lot of words!\rWe’re done for here... Let’s get back\nto the Valley Windworks.\r
Oh, what’s this thing?\nThey seem to have forgotten it...\rIt’s a Works Key...\nIt must be for the Valley Windworks!\rIt’s of no use to me.\nYou may as well have it.\r
Thank you!\nYou surely saved me.\rThose goons were trying to rob me\nof my sweet, sweet Honey.\rThey sure were weird, though.\nYou saw how they were dressed.\rWhat they were saying didn’t make\na whole lot of sense, either.\rOh! I need to thank you!\nWill you take this as my thanks?\r
If you slather that Honey on\na sweet-smelling tree, it might\fattract Pokémon.
Honey can attract Pokémon if it’s\nslathered on a tree and left a while.\rWould you like to buy some Honey\nfor a mere $100?
         
Oopsy!\nYou can’t hold any more.
Oopsy!\nYou don’t have enough money.
Oopsy!\nWell, come again.
