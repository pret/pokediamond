Are you a fan of the Day-Care\nCouple like me?\rI got hold of something quite useful.\rIt’s the latest Pokétch app from\nthe Pokétch Company.\rWhat’s more, they developed it in\ncollaboration with the Day Care.\rSince you’re a fellow fan of the Day\nCare, I’m compelled to share this!\r
With that Day-Care Checker, you can\ncheck on the Pokémon that you’ve\fleft with the Day-Care Couple.\rBut I haven’t been able to leave\nmy Pokémon... So here I stay...
Your bond with your Pokémon will\ndeepen as you travel together.
