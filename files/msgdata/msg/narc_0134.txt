Howdy, there!\rLet me examine your Pokémon to see\nif it’s worthy of a scarf!\r
Hmhm...\nI see...\r
This isn’t what I had hoped to see...\rI can’t lie to you, so I’ll just have\nto tell it to you straight.\rThis Pokémon’s not bad, but it’s not\ngood, either. It’s just so-so.\rIf you want to improve this one’s\ncondition, feed it some more Poffins!
Your Pokémon is growing up really\ngood. My hat’s off to you.\rI was going to give you a scarf,\nbut your Bag’s full.
Your {STRVAR 0, 0}’s looking good!\nI’d say it’s pretty impressive!\rI’ll tell you what, I’ll give you\nthis {STRVAR 8, 1}!\r
The Red Scarf stands for passion!\rLet a Pokémon hold it to give it\nan edge in Cool Contests.
The Blue Scarf represents the\nvastness of the sea!\rLet a Pokémon hold it to give it\nan edge in Beauty Contests.
The Pink Scarf represents charm!\rLet a Pokémon hold it to give it\nan edge in Cute Contests.
The Green Scarf represents the\nspring breeze!\rLet a Pokémon hold it to give it\nan edge in Smart Contests.
The Yellow Scarf stands for\ntoughness!\rLet a Pokémon hold it to give it\nan edge in Tough Contests.
I’m out of scarves to give you!\nI’m out of things to say, too!
My brother’s girlfriend is the\nMassage Girl in Veilstone City.\rThey stay in touch by having Pokémon\nhold Mail for each other.
PACHIRISU: Suuu pasuu!
