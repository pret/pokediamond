Hello.\nMay I help you with anything?
Hello, {STRVAR 259, 0}.\nMay I help you with anything?
Please enjoy yourself.
False Swipe makes wild Pokémon easier\nto catch.\rMany customers have confided that to\nme recently.
For Fire-type Pokémon, may I suggest\nFire Blast?
The move Protect is the perfect\nsolution for dodging attacks.\rPlease be aware that overuse can\nresult in failure.
When it is raining, the accuracy\nof Thunder becomes precise.\rPlease do be careful about\nthe weather.
A friend traded me a MACHOKE using\nDS Wireless Communications.\rBut instead of a MACHOKE, I got\na different Pokémon!
I wrote some secrets in my Mail\nas a reminder...\rIf someone reads it...\nI’m in deep trouble.
