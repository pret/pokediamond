{STRVAR 3, 0}: Hunh?\rOh, it’s you, {STRVAR 3, 1}!\nYou finally got here?\fYou’re slow like always.\rYou’re so slow, the Gym Leader’s\nlong gone now.\rHe said he had to go... Uh...\nOh, yeah, to Oreburgh Mine!\rI got my Badge already, so it’s no\nbig deal to me, but...
{STRVAR 3, 0}: I told you, the Gym\nLeader isn’t here.\rIf you want to take the Gym\nchallenge, you’d better go down to\fthe mine and ask him.\rBut, boy, a Gym Leader is in a\ndifferent class of toughness.\rEven I’m feeling run down.
{SIZE 200}Thud!!{SIZE 100}\r
{STRVAR 3, 0}: Whoops! {STRVAR 3, 1}!\nYou got the Gym Badge, huh?\rEterna City is the next place with\na Gym that gives away Badges, right?\r
So, yeah, I went to Route 207, but\nyou can’t go there without a Bicycle.\rI made my team battle and toughened\nthem up, so it wasn’t a waste.\r
So, I’m going back to Jubilife City.\nNext stop, the Eterna Gym Badge!\rTen seconds before I dash!\rNine...\rBah! Who’s got time to count?!\r
Howdy, Trainer!\rIf you don’t have a single Gym Badge,\nother Trainers will look down on\fyou like you’re a total noob, right?\rSo, I’ll show you where the town’s\nPokémon Gym is.\r
Huh?\nThere’s someone there.
Is that guy in front of the Gym\nyour friend?\rHe’s sort of twitchy and impatient.
Oh, hi, you’re back!\nThe Gym Leader’s waiting for you.
Can I see your Trainer Case?\rIt’s got the Gym Badge you just\nwon, right?
                                                                                                                               
                               
                                                                                                                                           
The Gym Leader went off to work in\nthe mine.
The Gym Leader is young, but he’s\nthe mine’s safety supervisor.\rHe’s an expert in more than just one\nfield!
Everyone’s proud of the mine.\rThey’re digging for coal under the\nsea as we speak...\rIt’s amazing how they do it!
Up ahead there’s a huge mountain\nthat towers above everything.\rIt divides Sinnoh into two distinct\nhalves.
Have you seen the vents?\nThey release steam from down below.
                              
These vents exchange the hot air\ndown below with the fresh air outside.\rLooking down them gives me the urge\nto start yelling into ’em! Hello!
There’s no question. This is hard,\nhard work.\rBut working alongside Pokémon...\nIt gives me a boost somehow.\rHere, take one of these.\r
Feeling hale and hearty puts a smile\non my face. And that makes me happy.
This pile of dirty sand is called\na slag heap.\rIt’s the waste from sorting coal.
Chop, chop, MACHOP!\nChop, chop away on rocks! ~♫
TMs are single use only, but HMs\ncan be used over and over.\rIt’s tricky trying to decide which\nPokémon should learn what moves.
When I run around with my Running\nShoes on, it feels like I’m the center\fof attention!
MACHOP: Macho! Chopo!
