You’ve got a Sphere or two?\nIf you do, I’ll trade you something.
Which Sphere will you trade me for\nmy {STRVAR_1 25, 2}?
All right!\nLet’s do this trade!
Oh, now wait a second!\nYou don’t have any room for this!
That’s not the right kind of Sphere!
Hmm...\nNo, this Sphere’s not big enough.
The {STRVAR_1 25, 2}\nwas obtained!
You obtained a {STRVAR_1 25, 2},\nsize {STRVAR_1 51, 6}.
Do you need anything else?
I’ll be seeing you, then!
You’ll trade your {STRVAR_1 25, 2}\nfor my {STRVAR_1 25, 4}?
All right!\nLet’s trade!
Oh, now wait a second! You don’t\nhave room for another Sphere!

Roark: Hey! {STRVAR_1 3, 0}!\nIs this maybe your first time here?\rWelcome to Sinnoh’s Underground!\rHuh? Where is this, you ask?\nDoesn’t the Radar make it obvious?\rThis is a giant underground network\nof passages underneath Sinnoh.\rHuh? What am I doing down in this\nexpanse of a place?\rThat’s kind of hard to answer.\rI mean, you can do pretty much\nanything you want down here.\rFor instance, you can dig up Treasure,\nSpheres, and make a Secret Base.\rYou can play with your friends down\nhere, too.\rYou should talk to the Underground\nMan in Eterna City.\rI have to get going now.\nI’ll see you around!
