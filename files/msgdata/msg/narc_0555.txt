Here I come!
Yeah!\r
Bleah!\r
Hey, rookie!\nBring it on!
Yeah, I knew it.\nYou’re a rookie after all.\r
Bleah!\nYou’re just a rookie!\r
I gotta say it, shorts are the best!\nThey remain comfy and easy to wear!
Shorts are the greatest!\r
I’ll never stop wearing shorts.\nNot for anybody!\r
I make it a policy to wear\nminiskirts!
Miniskirts are the ultimate!\r
What’s your policy?\r
I love my miniskirt!
Caught you snoozing!\r
Miniskirts make legs look longer!\nIs that a good thing?\r
I’m on the lookout for adorable\naccessories.
Let me know if you find any nice\naccessories!\r
I wish I could dress up!\r
I want to test out something I\nlearned at private school.
Yes!\nIt worked perfectly!\r
Hmm...\nSomething’s wrong here.\r
Uh... Wroar!
A battle is about momentum and\nwillpower.\r
OK, so willpower doesn’t cut it on\nits own.\r
I study every day because I want to\nwork all over the world.
My dream is worldwide!\r
I need to study up on Pokémon\nbattles.\r
When I grow up, I’m going to be a\nPokémon professor!
Er-hem! Er-hem!\nYou’ve much to learn, youngster!\r
Er-hem! Er-hem!\nSeems I’ve much to learn still!\r
When the subject is Pokémon, I simply\ndon’t lose!
It’s a victory of knowledge!\r
I’m going to review the subject!\nAnd I’ll subject you to my revenge!\r
Oh, now you look wimpy.\nI might win this.
I so did it!\r
Ouch, that hurt.\r
It’s fine, fine.\nNo need to say a word.
It’s fine, fine.\nYou tried your best, I know.\r
It’s fine, fine...\nNo need to say a word...\r
I’m rich!
Well, of course.\nI’m rich.\r
What happened?\nI’m rich, aren’t I?\r
Hmm. So, you’re good, huh?
Hmm. You’re no big deal.\nHmm?\r
Hmm. So, you are good.\nHmm.\r
Oh, yes.\nI shall attack now.
I’ve done it!\r
Oh, how disappointing.\r
Over it is, your adventure.\nCome hither and get whupped!
A done deal, it was.\r
Oh, how vexing this so is.\nVerily, I thank you.\r
How boring...
So truly boring...\r
That was a good way to waste some\ntime.\r
Hunh?\nWhere is everyone?
Hey, guys!\nWhere are you?!\r
I came to camp, but I think I got\nseparated from my friends...\r
Oh!\nYou have a Pokétch too?
I was fooling around with my\nPokétch, but I still won!\r
I was fooling around with my\nPokétch, and I lost...\r
My Pokémon trained in forests.
It’s the power of the forests.\r
I’m going back to the forest.\r
I’ll battle you like I’m on a picnic!
Lalala!\r
Pretending this is a picnic won’t let\nme win.\r
Ooh-la-la!\nHere we come!
Ooh-la-la!\nSo happy I won!\r
Ooh-la-la!\nEven losing can’t dampen my spirits!\r
I’ll teach you what’s fun about\nbattling.
Battling me was fun, wasn’t it?\r
Oh, my, that was inspiring!\nYou’re the greatest!\r
I... I can swim, really!\nI don’t need my inner tube!
It... It’s true!\r
I... I’m not lying!\r
I like rivers more than the sea.\nWhich do you prefer?
Water in rivers is cold, but it feels\njust super.\r
I don’t like the sea because the\nsalty water burns my eyes!\r
Go, go, go!\nGo, my Pokémon!
That’s the way!\nWay to go, my Pokémon!\r
Good effort!\nWay to go, my Pokémon!\r
The beach sand is so hot! It makes\nme go, “Ouch, ouch, ouch!”
I love the sea!\r
Ouch, ouch, ouch!\r
Splish, splash!
Ker-splash!\nKer-splash!\r
Flip, flop!\r
I’m a girl in love with her inner\ntube! Nice to meet you!
Thank you! I’m a girl in love with\nher inner tube!\r
Good-bye! I’m a girl in love with her\ninner tube!\r
Oh, yeah! I’m feeling it!\nI’m tuned in to your wavelength!
Tadaaaah!\r
Tch!\nLosing threw off my rhythm!\r
Rock? Jazz? Techno?\nAnything’ll do for my sound track!
Squeeeeeal!\r
So, yeah... You’ve got me in the\nmood for singing the blues...\r
Let’s get this session on!
You’re obviously short on practice.\r
My dream of a world tour...\nIt seems so far away...\r
Oh, hello...\nWell, isn’t that a chic scarf!
Where did you buy that scarf?\r
Oh, you! You’re not just fashionable,\nyou’re good with Pokémon! How unfair!\r
Thanks for supporting me!
Oh?\nYou’re not my fan?\r
What a horrible way to treat\nan idol...\r
La, lala, lah.
La lalala.\nLalalah lah.\r
Bye-bye, lalah!\r
Let’s see who loves Pokémon more,\nyou or me.
Fuhaha! Looks like my love for\nPokémon trumped yours!\r
Grr... Your love of Pokémon is\nstronger than mine?\r
I tell ya, my Pokémon are some kind\nof tough.
You don’t want to underestimate me.\r
You’re some kind of mighty.\r
OK, show me your favorite Pokémon.\nDon’t be shy now, come on.
I see...\nCute, but on the weak side.\r
I see!\nCute, and yet tough.\r
My Pokémon are cute, but they’re\nnot very tough!
Oh?\nWe won? Seriously?\r
It’s OK. I like my Pokémon.\nThat’s all that matters.\r
I’ve been pampering my gang too\nmuch lately. Can they do it?
Ooh, they did it!\nI knew I could count on my gang!\r
Pampering Pokémon too much is\nno good...\r
Won’t you join our Pokémon Fan\nClub?
There’s all sorts of fun things to\ndo if you join!\r
Join us!\nBecome a Pokéfan like me!\r
May I take your order, please?
Ah, a fine choice.\nOne loss served fresh.\r
Ah, an excellent choice.\nA win served fresh.\r
What I really hoped to become\nwas a cook.
I don’t mind this job now, mind you.\r
I just find it hard talking to\nstrangers.\r
For battles and order taking, speed\nis essential!
Like, chop-chop!\nYou got served.\r
Food is like battling.\nServe it while it’s hot!\r
My job is about serving others.\nBut don’t expect me to serve here.
Mufufu.\r
Why couldn’t you serve me?\nYou won’t make friends that way!\r
Isn’t this cute?\nMy uniform.
It’s my favorite!\r
You messed up my uniform!\r
You’re good, aren’t you?
Oops.\nI’m a little disappointed.\r
I knew you were a tough Trainer.\r
I catch and raise all sorts of\nPokémon.
See?\nI’ve raised them pretty good.\r
I need to raise my Pokémon some\nmore!\r
I’ll snag you with my net!
It’s in the bag!\r
Hey!\nDon’t run away!\r
Where can I find a giant HERACROSS?
I want a huge HERACROSS.\nLike, king size!\r
If only I had a giant HERACROSS...\r
Prepare to lose!
The enemy is mine!\r
I lie shattered...\r
Behold my fearsome ninja technique!
Hahah!\nYou saw it!\r
You didn’t fall for my fake ninja\nboasting!\r
I shall become a real ninja when\nI grow up!
Excellent! Excellent!\r
So, what’s a real ninja supposed to\ndo?\r
Should I torment you?
Yay! Yay!\r
No!\nNo tormenting me!\r
My mommy made this outfit for me.
Isn’t it cute?\r
My mommy is really good at sewing.\r
Let’s do our best, everyone!
Thanks, everyone!\r
Waaaaah!\r
Sure, we’re going to battle, but\ndon’t be over the top about it.
Hey, relax, relax.\nIt’s best to be natural, dig?\r
You have to loosen up some more.\r
Fish, fish, fish, that’s what I do!\nI’m gonna fish it all up!
Kahahah!\nI am at the top of my game!\r
Oh, waah!\nI let that get away!\r
Exploring relics isn’t all fun and\ngames!
Your skill level says you probably\nwon’t make a good Ruin Maniac.\r
Danger lurks everywhere in ruins!\r
These mates of mine traveled the\nworld with me!
What do you say?\nPretty tough, right?\r
Maybe it’s time we hit the road\nagain...\r
Hey, there! Check this out!\nMy rare Pokémon!
Not just rare, either.\nMy Pokémon are tough, too!\r
Aiyah! Hey! Wait!\nNo! Stop! Don’t touch!\r
Now just be patient.\nI’ll show you my private collection!
See, see? Weren’t they awesome?\nThey’re the most super of the uber!\r
Awawawah... My...\nMy Pokémon...\r
Look! This is my favorite parasol!\nOh, and my fabulous Pokémon!
Aren’t they both cute?\r
I’m only showing you!\nYou can’t have any!\r
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
Have you wondered what lies beyond\na rainbow?\r
Seeing a rainbow makes me think good\nthings are in store.\r
If you were the weather, what\nwould you be now?
Right now, I’m feeling sunny\nwithout a cloud in the sky!\r
I’m feeling fogbound...\r
I really don’t like weak Trainers!
You don’t inspire much trust...\r
A Pokémon Trainer should be tough\nand bursting with life!\r
Lately, I’ve had a lot to worry\nabout...
Winning makes all my worries seem\ntrivial!\r
You just added to my worries...\r
This may hurt a little bit, but we’ll\nbe done quick. Hold still!
There! Done!\r
Ooh, no!\nThat hurts!\r
Sniff... Sniffle...
Sniffle... Snuffle...\nI think I have a cold...\r
Sniff... Sniffle...\nMy nose is clogging up...\r
Sniff...
Now what could this aroma be?\r
Do you have some cologne on?\nYou smell sort of nice!\r
You’re going to lose, but you’ll get\nto enjoy a nice aroma!
Kyahaha! That’s what you get for\nswooning to my aroma!\r
Kiiiih!\nI am so angry!\r
Let my guitar howl!\nHear me scream!
Yeahey!\r
Giyaaaah!\r
You should channel your feelings into\nsongs with sincerity, man.
The way I feel now?\nIt’s rock!\r
The way I feel now is kind of folksy.\r
Now hear me!\nThe Bird Keeper’s credo number one!
Soar high on a win!\r
Rest your wings on a loss!\r
Let’s both do our best!
Yup, we both did the best we could!\r
Good going!\r
Fly, fly, fly!\nWe’re going to rule this battle!
Zoom!\r
We’re gonna crash!\r
I’m the Sailor among Sailors!\nI was born on the high seas!
The waves rocked me to sleep!\nThe sea was my mother!\r
Urp... Gweh... So, when I get up on\nland, I get no-motion sickness...\r
The sea, my beautiful sea!
Oh... I hear them...\nI hear the sound of waves...\r
I want to become a big man.\nBig like the sea big.\r
Yahoo!
Come on!\nYou holler too!\r
Gweff! Hack! Hack!\nHollering choked me up!\r
You should aspire to the Hiker’s\nway of life!
You see?\nYou love my lifestyle, don’t you?\r
Now, come on now!\nYou should look up to the way I live!\r
My Pokémon and I are idols!
Say what you will!\nWe’re idols!\r
We have you beat when it comes down\nto popularity...\r
Watch me!\nAll eyes on me!
Ooh...\nThis is what I live for...\r
I became an idol because I wanted\neveryone to see me!\r
I’m too into battling...\nThey might fire me as an idol...
Battling is too much fun!\r
I can’t help myself.\nNo one can keep me from battling.\r
I run a marathon every morning!\nIt’s great!
My buff physique makes for easy\nwins!\r
So I lost!\nI can still run great marathons!\r
I’ll run on the spot while battling\nfor the good of my health.
Let’s hear it for good health!\r
Gasp!\nMy ankle! I rolled my ankle!\r
Out of the way!\nI’ve got deliveries to make!
What? You want me to deliver you\nsomewhere, too?\r
All the delivering I do every day...\nI’ve got deep muscle pain!\r
It was me who put up the buildings\naround these parts.
So, what do you think?\nCool stuff, huh?\r
My dream is to make a building taller\nthan a mountain!\r
Smell that? That’s the smell of hay\nclinging to my body.
Whoa!\r
This smell I have is the sweet scent\nof hay that Pokémon surely love.\r
All right, take a run at me!\nMy barrel chest can take it!
What? That’s all you’ve got?\nYou can take a harder run at me!\r
Ooh... Ow... That hurt... It’s like\nyou broke my barrel chest...\r
I’m not getting any younger.\nI can’t overexert myself.
What I lack in youth, I make up for\nin experience.\r
Oh, you’re good and young.\nThere’s a sparkle about you.\r
Hey! You there, Trainer!\nYou and me, we’re battling!
Owned!\r
Unbelievable!\r
These here are my Pokémon.\nI raised them with my ma and pa.
Sure right kind of tough, aren’t\nthey?\r
Well, I’ll be!\nWe lost that one!\r
I’m going to do my level best.\nYou’d better keep up!
Whew! We sure did our best!\r
Yup! We tried hard, y’all!\r
OK, everyone!\nBig smiles!
Big smiles!\nCome on!\r
That’s a great smile! Your victory\npose is picture perfect, too!\r
Zoom in on you!
Spot-on focus!\r
Zoom out, fade...\r
This camera is pretty hefty, actually.
My shoulder is always rock stiff...\nMy camera’s toughened me up.\r
Oof...\nI’m feeling groggy...\r
Hello there, Trainer!\nPlease battle with me!
Thanks for your help!\r
I appreciate the lesson!\r
I’ll do anything for a good news\nstory!
I’m relentless about battling, too!\r
Stop! Please, stop!\nYou’ll break my mic!\r
So, the question is, what is your\nopinion of me?
“What a tough Trainer!” Is that\nwhat you’re thinking?\r
I’m doing a live report on the topic\nof myself!\r
Come on!\nWe’ll run! Together!
Gooooooooaaaaal!\r
Wait!\nDon’t leave me behind!\r
Gear change!\nWe’re attacking at top speed!
Vrooooom!\r
Kaboom!\r
Can you keep up with my Pokémon at\na full run?
Too slow!\r
I’m taking it to a zone beyond\nspeed!\r
I’d rather cycle casually than go\nfull speed.
Let’s take it easy.\r
You ought to take things more\ncasually...\r
I only know how to go at full power,\neven against a younger opponent!
Full power is how I win!\r
Please! Let me call you Master\nTrainer from now on!\r
My spirit burns, my fists are steel,\nand my sweat cascades!
Hrrumph!\r
I sweated more. That makes\nme the victor!\r
En garde!
I’m still ready for more.\r
Urgh... I won’t forget this!\r
Hey! Come on!
Nice fight!\r
You’re not bad, you.\r
The ultimate of my technique!\nExperience it in its entirety!
I am the greatest!\nGwahahaha!\r
I’ve fallen in defeat?\nGw-gwaaah!\r
Hi! Little kid!\nA battle, please!
Little kid!\nThank you very kindly!\r
Little kid!\nI’m really upset over this!\r
I, um... I’ve never actually learned\nhow to do karate.
You’re kidding?!\nI’m naturally talented?!\r
A Black Belt is cool, huh?\nSo I just dress up like one.\r
It’s been five years since I took to\nthe mountains. My hair’s grown wild!
I bathe every day!\nHow dare you?\r
Another five years...?\r
Did I catch you smirking at my\neight-pack abs?
You don’t appreciate the beauty of\npure muscles!\r
Musculature is the ultimate beauty!\r
In love and in battles, I’ve never\ntasted defeat!
See? We won again!\r
So, I lost. I don’t care!\nI have a date soon, so I don’t care!\r
This is it! Over the top!\nEveryone charge!
The enemy Trainer has fallen!\nVictory is ours!\r
Retreat!\nSound the retreat!\r
My career as a Trainer dates back\n75 years. You think you can win?
Here’s a toast to my history!\r
My history of glory...\r
Are you prepared?
Ah, a superb battle that was.\r
I tip my hat to you.\r
Oh, my...\nSuch an adorable Trainer...
Are we disappointed?\nHow adorable...\r
I see...\nYou’re more than simply adorable.\r
Eee-yeah!
A stirring shout, wouldn’t you say?\nI find it quite bracing.
Gasp... Gasp...\nOh, dear... I’m worn out.\r
Being rich doesn’t shield me from\nhaving worries...
Of course, being well off is much\npreferable to poverty, but...\r
Lavish parties day after day...\nIt gets rather tiresome, I must say.\r
Come to know defeat...\nLearn what it means to battle...
I see you becoming ever more\npowerful...\r
The defeated merely slink away...\r
Look into my eyes!
You fell under my spell!\r
My power of suggestion failed to\ncharm you!\r
...
...Did it.\r
I focused my mind in silence...\r
My powers!\nThere’s no trickery about them!
This is psychic power!\r
There really is no trickery...\r
Take it all!
Ahaha!\r
Gah!\r
Close your eyes and count...\nSlow... Slower...
That was the countdown to my\nvictory!\r
Tch...\nI thought I could lull you to sleep.\r
I live among Pokémon.
I’ve never been much of a battler,\nbut...\r
I’m just not much of a battler.\r
...They’re Pokémon I’ve raised with\nmy father...
...Dad, are you seeing this?\nI did it...\r
Dad, I can’t...\nI need to raise them some more...\r
Raising Pokémon takes a lot of\nhonest effort!
Yahaha! I’ve had a hands-on time\nraising those Pokémon!\r
Urgwah!\nLook what you’ve done to my Pokémon!\r
Will you have a look at the Pokémon\nI’ve raised?
Well?\nCute, aren’t they?\r
Cut a girl some slack!\r
I specialize in raising cute Pokémon!
Cute, yet strong! Right?\r
Oh, but they’re so cute!\r
Nice to meet you!\nUnderestimate me at your peril!
Told you!\r
I guess I underestimated you...\r
Hmhm... I must say I like the look\nin your eyes.
Your eyes remain unclouded in defeat.\nLike jewels they are!\r
Your eyes shine brighter than any\nbig gemstone I keep at home!\r
When I was your age, I was quite\nthe daredevil, I must say.
Seeing you reminds me of my own wild\nyouth.\r
I daresay, you’re quite the daredevil\nyourself!\r
If you want to run home to mommy,\nhere’s you chance, punk!
Geheheh!\r
Waah!\nI want my mommy!\r
Battles achieve nothing!\nTake my hand! It’s about love!
I didn’t mean to battle--but take my\nhand! It’s about love!\r
Battling is futile!\nTake my hand! It’s about love!\r
I dropped my glasses.\nI can’t see straight.
I guess I won.\nI can’t see enough to tell.\r
I guess I lost.\nI can’t see enough to tell.\r
Steadily and surely.\nYou build from the little things up.
Steadily and surely is how I won!\r
But I did things steadily and\nsurely...\r
Hehehehe...
Gehahahaha!\r
Sob, sob, sob...\r
Everybody gather around for my\nstupendicular Pokémon show!
Wasn’t that amusing?\r
Nrrgh...\nI am not amused.\r
I shall train with you.
Show some spine!\nOn your feet!\r
Fine!\nThat will do!\r
Why get all intellectual about things?\nIf it’s fun, why question it?
See, I can still win.\nI don’t see a problem!\r
So I lost!\nIf it’s fun, it’s cool!\r
I expect you to be good...\nDon’t you disappoint me!
My hope was misplaced...\r
You’ve got good things.\r
My papa and mama are high-skill\nTrainers, too.
It’s in my lineage!\r
Papa, Mama!\nI’m so sorry!\r
I go all out in battle, no matter\nwhat.
The inevitable conclusion!\r
I concede!\r
This is it! The biggest battle in my\nlife! I cannot afford to lose!
Woot, yeah!\r
This sets me back to being a Lass...\r
My love of nature and Pokémon made\na Ranger out of me!
I love to battle, too!\r
Ooh...\nI still love to battle, too.\r
Hi! Have you ever considered a\ncareer as a Ranger?
Well, you might not make it at your\nskill level.\r
Yes, you’ve got the mettle.\nBeing a Ranger is a lot of fun!\r
Win or lose, a battle happens only\nonce!
Do you have any regrets?\r
I have no regrets!\r
It’s my sworn duty to protect nature\nand the Pokémon in it.
It’s a challenging life, but there’s\na lot to enjoy every day.\r
It’s a rewarding career.\nHow does it sound to you?\r
My darling Pokémon will lay a licking\non you!
Well? Satisfied?\r
Well, aren’t you tough?\nI’m a little stunned!\r
I didn’t sleep while trying to come\nup with this new strategy!
My strategy worked!\r
Oh, but...\nI really needed to sleep tonight...\r
The credo of the Dragon Tamer!\nNumber one!
In victory, roar!\nRoar with your dragon!\r
Even in defeat, roar!\nRoar with your dragon!\r
Mighty! Like a dragon!
Strong, I am!\r
...Urf...\nI wanted to be strong...\r
See it! Feel it!\nThe ultimate power... Probably!
There is no defeat for me, the\nultimate... Probably!\r
The title of the ultimate probably!\nI confer it on you!\r
Oh, wow!\nRare Pokémon!
Hihihi... That’s what you get for\nletting down your guard.\r
Tch.\nCouldn’t fool you.\r
I can’t stand getting cold, but I’m\nquite good.
Ch-chatter...\nWa-wahaha. I won, I won!\r
Ch-chatter... Urr...\nI’m getting sleepy...\r
My ace Pokémon are on the go!
You surprise me!\nNot too shabby!\r
I like the sense you show!\r
Snow is wonderful!\nEverything becomes white.
Snow is so romantic!\r
I’m whiting out...\r
Don’t you think this coat is cute?\nIt limits my movements, though.
It’s toasty warm.\r
I feel snowed under...\r
I’m the one! Number one out of all\nthe kids in shorts!
See? That’s what being number one\nis about!\r
Darn...\nI’m number one...\r
I’m the one! The only one true one\namong shorts-wearing kids!
See? That’s what being the only one\nis about!\r
Darn...\nI’m the only one...\r
Um...\nI’m pleased to meet you.
Awawa... We won?\nUm? S-sorry.\r
Er, um...\nTh-thank you...\r
Here goes!
Bravo!\r
Yelp!\r
You learn too!
The harsh realities of battling!\r
The joy of victory!\r
Allow me to study you.
You offered me nothing new to learn.\r
I get it now. In that situation,\nI should have used that move.\r
My teacher gave me advice on\nbattling.
My teacher was right!\nThat was just so easy!\r
Aww, my teacher was wrong!\nNone of it worked!\r
Why are we battling?\nI don’t get it.
Why? I don’t understand.\r
Why did you win?\nWhat happens now?\r
Ultimately, Pokémon is just another\nbrand. You know who’ll win, right?
I’m not interested in what was an\ninevitable result.\r
But how... My...\nThe Pokémon I’ve raised...\r
There isn’t anything that I can’t\nbuy. Money can buy battles!
There’s nothing that money can’t\nbuy.\r
I’ll give you my allowance if you’ll\nlet me win.\r
You know, I’m really not cut out for\ndoing this socialite-lady thing...
Gahahahah!\r
You swine! Now I’m steamed!\r
I’ll be done with you lickety-split!
Lickety-split is how you were done!\r
Lickety-split is how I’ll excuse\nmyself!\r
Crunch-crunch...\nCrunch-crunch...
I love these crunchy Lava Cookies...\r
What am I standing on?\nBusted Poké Balls?\r
The way of the Bug Catcher!\nBear witness to it!
This is the way of the Bug Catcher!\r
All hail Bug Catchers!\r
Feast your eyes on secret techniques\nof the ancients!
See? What did you think?\nAre you awestruck?\r
That’s my cue to disappear in a puff\nof smoke.\r
I see it!
Think not ill of me...\r
Gyoeeeh!\r
Pikaaa!
Pikapikaaah!\r
Pi pika...\r
A battle, you say?\nI’m never losing to you!
Yeehah! Yippee!\nI won, I won!\r
Urk...\nWe lost...\r
It’s my job to be cute!
Just being cute is money in the bank!\r
Ugagaah!\nYou rotten thief!\r
You can shake hands with me!\nIt would be quite the honor for you!
If you’d won, I would have even\ngiven you my autograph!\r
My management team will have\nsomething to say about this!\r
Run!\nDon’t think! Run!
Faster!\nMore! More! Faster!\r
Run!\nKeep running for me!\r
Hiya.\nNice to meet ya.
All right.\nNice seeing ya.\r
All right.\nThanks for coming by.\r
My cohorts call me the emperor of\nfishing!
I landed another big one today!\r
Why the emperor of fishing?\nIt’s an ancient Chinese legend...\r
When you get as good as me, you can\nwin easily, even if asleep.
Zzz... Zzz...\r
Sssnore...\r
My mom and I travel around in search\nof lost treasures.
The rest of the time, we fish and\ntend to crops every single day.\r
You sure seem to be hectic.\r
Win! That’s what I’ll do again today!\nI’ll win tomorrow, too!
Nahaha! Nahaha!\nI’m not gonna lose my whole life!\r
Nooooo! No way!\nI didn’t lose!\r
Allow me to examine your prowess as\na collector.
You’re still wanting.\nI urge you to keep at it.\r
That’s quite the collection.\nI’m willing to relieve you of the lot.\r
There! There! And there!
Yes, sir!\r
Owowowoooh!\r
I want you to hear it!\nA shout from the heart!
I love music!\r
Let’s hear it for an encore!\r
Battle?\nI’m up for that.
Wow.\nGood stuff.\r
Thanks much.\r
Fwoom!
Flap! Flap!\r
I’m gonna pluck you for that!\r
Sure, let’s duke it out!
Let’s battle again!\r
You’re not half bad!\r
Looking out over the sea’s breaking\nwaves... It revives memories.
Wroaaaaaar!\nDaddy!\r
Wroaaaar!\nMommy!\r
Come on! Take a run at me!\nI can take it!
So, what’d you think?\nI was too burly for you to handle?\r
Good job!\nWay to overcome my size!\r
Waah! Wait! Wait a second!\nMy mind’s not into this yet!
Hunh? It’s over already?\nWhat? I won, you say?\r
Huh? Hah? It’s over already?\nWhat? I lost, you say?\r
My favorite drink is Moomoo Milk.\nGot some?
Wahaha! I get the win!\nLet’s celebrate over some milk!\r
Gwaah! Moomoo Milk!\nBring me some Moomoo Milk!\r
You’re under arrest!\nYou’re under arrest!
Takedown!\r
Officer down!\r
I’m not a real Policeman.\nI’m a uniform collector.
You look like a uniform will suit you.\nYou should try to find one you like.\r
I must say, battling is a wonderful\nthing.\r
Who knows what happens tomorrow?
You can lose one day, and win the\nnext. That’s how it goes.\r
I might win tomorrow.\nThat’s what I believe.\r
I’m throwing my all into this match!
Yeah! Yahoo!\r
It’s over!\r
The indefatigable Camper makes his\nstand!
You can become a devotee if you’d\nlike.\r
I wish I could become your devotee.\r
I don’t think I have any chance of\nwinning, but sure, I’ll battle.
Wow, I wasn’t expecting to win.\r
I knew I’d lose.\nI’m so sorry for this.\r
I think you’re awfully interested in\nme, aren’t you?
You lost because you were paying too\nmuch attention to me.\r
Why did you win?\nI thought you liked me.\r
Win or lose, let’s not bear any\ngrudges.
Yay, yay, yay!\nWe did it!\r
Oh, you!\nDon’t ever forget this!\r
Pokémon are for adults, too...\nLet me show you...
What do you think?\nAm I deep like an old blues man?\r
Though it cuts me deep, it’s a man’s\nlot in life to endure the pain...\r
What I have here isn’t really a\nguitar.
Beep, boop, bzzt...\r
This here is a keyboard synth.\r
For work, I sometimes get to be a\nSwimmer or a Beauty.
An idol can become anybody!\r
But the real me...\nI’m still a Lass in a miniskirt!\r
Let’s enjoy ourselves.\nI hate anything to do with pain!
Ooh! That was fun!\r
Yowch! Watch it!\nYou play too rough!\r
I’ll put an end to this!\nWith my favorite Pokémon!
The love I have for my Pokémon is\ncomplete and perfectly strong...\r
Why? Why?!\nWhy did I lose?!\r
Living with Pokémon...\nEvery day is the greatest.
Ehehe...\nPokémon are the best...\r
It’s not a problem if I lose.\nI still have my Pokémon...\r
I have my Pokémon.\nI don’t need anything else.
With my Pokémon, I can be happy\nevery day.\r
Isn’t that the same for you?\nIsn’t it?\r
You won’t guess it now, but I was\nquite the party girl in my day.
Well, I still have it now, you know.\r
I feel nostalgic for those days...\r
Do your best!\nMy beloved children!
Wahaha! Well done!\nMama’s proud of you!\r
My Pokémon are my beloved family.\r
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t\nmatter which. Let’s do this!
Little boy? Little girl?\nDoesn’t matter which, but sorry.\r
Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t\nmatter which, but you’re sure tough!\r
Your ride ends here.
Told ya it’s over.\r
Too much for me to handle!\r
We’re going for the win!\nHey-ho, let’s go!
Yay! Vavavoom!\r
Aww, we lost...\nSniffle...\r
Let me introduce to you\nmy cherished partners!
How did you find them?\nMy cherished partners.\r
Awawa...\nMy partners...\r
Winning and losing isn’t all there is\nto battling.
Well, sure, it makes me happy when\nI win.\r
The effort you put in is what’s\nimportant.\r
It’s no good to be too harsh...\nBut pampering is also out...
Being a Pokémon Breeder is a deep\nand complex challenge.\r
Balance is key for raising good\nPokémon.\r
I’ll check how your Pokémon have\ngrown for you.
Not good enough!\nYour training style’s not up to par.\r
This is impressive! You’ve raised your\nPokémon really thoroughly.\r
I’ll win.\nNo lie.
See?\r
Huh!\r
Fwaah! Fwaah!\nYou think you can beat me?
Fwaah! Fwaah!\nI win!\r
Fwaah!\r
I’ve caught you now.\nGive up.
You weren’t bad.\nLet’s meet again.\r
How could this be...?\r
Yo, yo!\nLet’s have a fun time!
Thank you!\nLet’s play again!\r
Thanks!\nPlay with me again!\r
You’re no good at all.\nI’d better teach you.
No, no, this won’t do at all.\nUp on your feet. Never give up!\r
You’ve got good skills.\nYou tried hard, too. Excellent!\r
I’m jacking up the power to max!\nAll the way to eleven!
Ooh, yeah! I’m feeling electric!\r
Eeyow! I got zapped!\r
OK, bring it!
Hah! Too weak!\nKeep trying!\r
Hoh! You are tough!\nGive me a rematch!\r
You need to be serious with me!
Oh? That’s it?\r
OK...\nQuite remarkable...\r
Ahaha! Too bad for you!\nI’m your opponent!
Ahaha!\r
Aha...\nAhaha...\r
Are you nervous?\nLeave it to the dude!
That was a good battle.\nI hope we can meet again.\r
Whew...\nThe dude wasn’t expecting to lose.\r
The power of nature!\nLet me show you!
This is the power of nature!\r
Protect the natural environment...
A battle with me? I don’t know what\nyou’re talking about.
See?\nI thought this would happen.\r
Boo! Boo!\nThis is not right!\r
Fuhahaha!\nYour next challenge is me!
Fuhahaha! You seriously believed you\ncould defeat me?\r
Fuhahaha!\nLet us meet again!\r
Off you go! Face my team of totally\ntrained Pokémon!
Bravo!\nI knew my Pokémon would do it!\r
Oh, no! That’s awful!\nWhat have you done to my Pokémon?!\r
A battle is deadly earnest!\nNot a moment of inattention!
Never let down your guard!\r
I seemed to have let my mind\nwander...\r
Hey!
Heeey!\r
Hey...\r
I’m tough, that’s all.
I won, that’s all.\r
I lost, that’s all.\r
Shaah!
Hwooh!\r
Hawah!\r
I’ve been here for years, but I never\nget tired of this.
You might not think so, but I’m still\na kid. I’m in the same grade as you.\r
I’d like to keep battling Pokémon\neven when my hair is gray.\r
Let me make one thing clear...\nYou aren’t capable of beating me.
Did I not say? There is no possible\nchance of you beating me.\r
How could this be...? Only that girl\nwith the inner tube has beaten me...\r
Oh, my, a mere child.
Children these days...\nSo careless.\r
Children these days...\nQuite exuberant, methinks.\r
I would like my children to become\nstrong and distinguished Trainers.
It wouldn’t do if my children were\nonly as good as you...\r
It would be nice if they were as\nskilled as you...\r
Behold you shall!\nPsychic-mystifying power!
You see?\nPsychic-mystifying power!\r
No, but...\nPsychic-mystifying power...\r
My family will show you a good time!
Hold up, my family!\nThat’ll be enough already!\r
My beloved family...\r
Twirl, twirl, twirl...
Are you feeling dizzy?\r
Ooorgh...\nMy head’s spinning...\r
My big brother told me!\nEyes! Aim for the eyes!
Yay! I did it!\nMy big brother’s plan worked!
My big brother told me to lower\nthe foe’s accuracy!
Hoy! You look pretty tough.\nThis is gonna be fun!
I thought so!\nYou are tough!\r
Yup, you sure are tough.\nKeep it up!\r
Ah, welcome!\nI’m your server today!
Would you care to settle your bill?\r
Thank you so much!\r
Hello.\nWhatcha having?
Thanks a million!\r
Be seeing ya!\r
I love cute customers like you!\nI’ll serve you right!
Well, were you happy with the way\nI served you?\r
Oh, but...\nI’m not done serving you.\r
Stare...
You’ve got something on your nose.\r
You’re cool, all right.\nI had to stare.\r
I’ve waited a long time for a Trainer\nlike you to come along.
Yup, you’re as tough as I thought.\nYou even had me in trouble!\r
I knew it!\nYou are a tough Trainer!\r
Now how should I conduct this\noffensive?
Oh, now I need a better effort out\nof you than that.\r
Oh, you’re finished and content?\nOK, another time, then.\r
My Pokémon have a different taste\nfrom the usual bunch.
Did you notice the difference?\nMy party has rich depth.\r
Did you notice the difference?\nMy party is refreshingly dry.\r
Hiya!\nTough-looking Trainer, aren’t you!
This feeling of elation is bubbling\nup in me!\r
Ooch...\nYou’re too much to handle.\r
Varrroooom!\nWatch me go full throttle!
Vavavaroooom!\nI’m not close to redlining!\r
Vrrr... Vrruuu...\nI’m flat out of gas...\r
Jingle, jingle!
Skreeeech!\r
Thud!\r
It’s my dream to cycle with my\nboyfriend.
No riding double, though!\r
I wish I had a boyfriend!\r
What’s your motive?\nWhat brought you here?
You lose.\nNow what will you do?\r
Play it again.\r
We’ll keep this match dry.
I admire your technique.\r
I remain humbled...\r
You’re serious? A battle?\nAnd that’s against me?
Cackle!\nYou shouldn’t have tried!\r
Double wow!\r
I’ll dance and sing and rivet your\nattention!
Ooh, baby!\r
So much for riveting your attention.\nYou nailed my Pokémon!\r
Ready, start!
First across the finish line!\r
Waah! Wait for me!\r
Can you explain why I’m here?
I mean, who are you?\r
Why am I battling here?\r
My fishing-rod-handling technique is\nthe best in all Sinnoh. Check it out!
See it?\nSurprised, I bet!\r
How I handle my fishing rod has\nnothing to do with battling...\r
The two loves of my life are fishing\nand battling.
I feel fantastic when I land a big\nfish or win a big battle.\r
I was born to fish and battle!\r
I come here on a ship.\nBig ship it was.
Sinnoh, I like.\nVery nice place.\r
You want go to sea? My ship, we will\nsee wonderful things.\r
Huh? You’re my opponent?\nThis is kind of unnerving...
I’m surprised...\nI didn’t think I’d win.\r
See, I told you...\nI thought you were tough.\r
Hahah! Howdy!
Hahah! Keep it coming!\r
Thanks for your time!\r
Let’s be good sports about this!\nBig smile!
Ahaha! Ahaha!\nCome on, you laugh too!\r
I’m cheerful even in defeat!\nAhaha! Ahaha!\r
Buck up.
Not bad.\r
You’re good.\r
The sweetest thing about battling?\nThe finishing blow!
Take that!\nThat’s my finishing move!\r
Oof...\nI feel your final shots...\r
Hey, you’re looking nifty!
Hey, you tried, right?\r
Hey, you’re kind of tough.\r
Listen! This is my chorus group.\nMe and my Pokémon!
Shooby-dooby doowop!\r
Oh, wait!\nWe’re not done singing!\r
I got tips from my online friends on\nhow to best raise my gang.
I must thank my online friends.\nI don’t know who they are, though.\r
Well, this blows!\nMy online buddies let me down!\r
Can I have a moment?\nI’m trying to write some e-mail.
I need to get home quick and check\non my e-mail.\r
What do you think you’re doing?\nI want to go already.\r
Father... Mother...\nPlease watch over me...
Father... Mother...\nWere you watching...?\r
Father... Mother...\nPlease forgive me...\r
Can’t rightly say I much like\nbattling, I tell you.
I won, but...\nI’m still shaking...\r
Grr...\nI’m so angry I could cry...\r
It’s the power of science!
Did you see? Were you amazed?\nThat’s the power of science!\r
It’s inconceivable... How could the\npower of science be defeated?\r
Charge, my Pokémon! Demonstrate the\nfruits of our experimentation!
Yes, my Pokémon proved my theory!\nI’ll get my professorship now!\r
What kind of experiments?\nThat’s classified.
I shall regress to my childhood for\nthis battle.
Googoo gagga.\r
Gagga...\r
Fwahahaha!\nYou’ve come a long way!
Fwahahahaha!\r
Fwahahaha!\nYou’re blessed to have your friends!\r
I’ll scrap you.
I’ll recycle you.\r
Think ecology. Think green.\r
Why, sure! Sounds great!\nWe have to do this!
Bam! All done!\r
A battle while working...\nIt’s a good way to take a break.\r
I’ll try to do my best!\nPlease give me this chance!
I’ve done it!\nI’ve achieved my goal!\r
I tried the best I could!\nThank you for your encouragement!\r
A battle is... It is a love letter\nwritten in sand.
Did you understand what I’m trying\nto say? I guess you wouldn’t.\r
Did you understand what I’m trying\nto say? I guess you wouldn’t.\r
Hello, you there! Yes, you!\nHold up. Hold it, I say!
OK, kids shouldn’t be out now.\nGo home, and be quick about it.\r
You shouldn’t mess with a police\nofficer like that.\r
Sssnork... Zzz...
CLEFAIRY... Mumble...\nWait for me... Sssnork...\r
Mutter...\nEhehe... Ssssnore...\r
Let’s keep this elegant!
Mmm, yes!\r
You’re quite the Trainer yourself!\r
A battle isn’t something you can\ncalculate.
What’d I tell you?\nYou win when you win.\r
What’d I say, huh?\nYou lose when you lose.\r
There’s lots in life that doesn’t\ngo the way you want.
Yippee!\nThings went my way!\r
See...?\r
There’s nowhere to run or hide!
This was a foregone conclusion!\r
Farewell!\r
I wait for tough Trainers here,\ncome rain or shine.
Because of that, I’ve grown so very\nstrong...\r
Won’t a tough... No, forget that.\nI need a cool Trainer to come...\r
This is for keeping the sun off.
I’m strong at battling, but I can’t\ntake sunlight...\r
I don’t want to roast my skin.\r
Well...\nThose are rare Pokémon...
I’ve never caught those...\nYour Pokémon are different, all right.\r
Oh, you’re a Trainer?\nYou’re not a Pokémon?\r
Ready?
Cool.\r
Bye.\r
Beat me?\nTry again in another ten years!
No spine!\r
You’re tough!\nYou inspire me!\r
Smelling sweet scents makes me so\ndrowsy...
...Yawn...\nOh? Are we finished so soon?\r
...Yawn...\nOh, really? I lost?\r
You’re sure you can handle me?\nI’m an ultrastellar talent.
Don’t feel bad!\nI’m an ultrastellar talent!\r
You’re in the miracle-star class!\r
I live only for battles.\nOnly victories give me hope.
...Naturally.\r
Who are you...?\r
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
Now come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon,\nwhat you’re really made of!
A magnificent bout that was!\nDo come visit again!\r
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like\nyou... I can live with that.\r
Now come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon,\nwhat you’re really made of!
A magnificent bout that was!\nDo come visit again!\r
Losing to an outstanding Trainer like\nyou... I can live with that.\r
