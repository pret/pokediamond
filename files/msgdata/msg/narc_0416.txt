Dawn: {STRVAR 259, 1}?!\rDid you tell your family that you’re\nhelping the professor?\r...You didn’t, did you?\rI know that you’re really eager to\nsee all kinds of Pokémon.\rBut you shouldn’t make your mom\nworry that you’ve disappeared.\r
Dawn: You should go tell your family\nthat you’re helping the professor.\rThe faster the better, too.\r
Dawn: Oh, that’s right!\r{STRVAR 259, 1}, I haven’t shown you\nhow to catch a Pokémon.\rI’ll demonstrate how to catch \none, so just watch me, OK?\r
Dawn: Giggle...\nSee? Isn’t it neat?\rActually, it’s better to lower your\ntarget’s HP more than I did.\rIt’s important to get the Pokémon’s\nHP down as low as possible.\rThis is because a healthy Pokémon\nis very difficult to catch.\rOh, Pokémon also get easier to catch\nif you make them sleep or something\fby using a Pokémon’s move.\rOK, {STRVAR 259, 0}, to get you\nstarted, I’ll give you five\fPoké Balls!\r
If you have lots of Pokémon with you,\nit will be safer on long trips.\rPlus, it will be a lot more fun\nhaving your Pokémon friends along.\rOK, I need to get going.\nBye, now!\r
Lucas: {STRVAR 259, 1}?!\rDid you tell your family that you’re\nhelping the professor?\r...I bet you didn’t, did you?\rI know that you’re eager to\nsee all kinds of Pokémon.\rBut you shouldn’t make your mom\nworry that you’ve upped and left.\r
Lucas: Why don’t you go tell your\nfamily that the professor asked for\fyour help?\rYou should do it right away.\r
Lucas: {STRVAR 259, 1}, do you know\nhow to catch a Pokémon?\rI’ll demonstrate how to catch\none, so just watch, OK?\r
Lucas: And that’s how it’s done.\rActually, I should have lowered the\ntarget’s HP some more.\rYup, the important thing is to lower\nthe Pokémon’s HP as much as possible.\rSee, a healthy Pokémon isn’t easy to\ncatch.\rOh, yeah. They also get easier to\ncatch if you make one of your\fPokémon put them to sleep or such.\rHere, {STRVAR 259, 0}, I’ll give you\nfive Poké Balls to get you started.\r
If you have lots of Pokémon with you,\nyou’ll be able to travel farther.\rThat way, you’ll have a better shot\nat meeting more Pokémon.\rSee you around!\r
Some Pokémon only appear in the\nmorning. Some only come out at night.\rI’m going to keep waiting right here\ntill I’ve seen every last one of ’em!
