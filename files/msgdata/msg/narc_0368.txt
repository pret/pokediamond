Reporter: I’m bringing you this report\nfrom the second floor of Jubilife TV.\rI’m here to examine a recently added\nphoto titled “{STRVAR 28, 1}”\fwhich belongs to {STRVAR 3, 0}.\rOh, is this it here?\nLet’s see...\rThe title “{STRVAR 28, 1}” does\nsound fitting for this photo...\rBut one can’t help but think perhaps\na better title could have been found.\rAll controversy aside, it’s certainly\nworth seeing.
