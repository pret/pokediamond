I’m going to be a Sailor like my\ndaddy!\rHe’s a real man among men!\nEven the sea doesn’t scare him!\rOh, but a Gym Leader’d be cool, too!\nByron is so awesome!
The little boy is thrashing about\nin his sleep.\rHe appears to be in torment...\nHe is muttering something...\r“DAR...\nDARK...is watching...me...”
The little boy is thrashing about\nin his sleep.\r{STRVAR 259, 0}’s Lunar Wing began\nto glow...\rThe boy’s sleeping face became\nuntroubled and serene!\r
The little boy woke up!
I couldn’t wake up...\nI saw it...\rIt was a scary dream...\nIt was a dark place...\fAnd there was a dark Pokémon...\rBut, Daddy, Mommy...\nI could always hear your voices...
Oh, my gosh!\nYou’re awake!\rOh, my son...\nI... I don’t know what to say...\r
Thank you!\nWe’ll never forget you!\r
Seeing you back to normal makes\nme feel great!\rI’ve regained my spirit as a Sailor!\nCome sail with me later!\r
Our boy has too much energy!\nI wish he’d be a little quieter.
I never thought our boy would fall\ninto this endless nightmare...\rIt’s happened in the past in\nCanalave...\rThere were people who never woke\nup from their nightmares...
Thank you! We can’t thank you\nenough, but thank you!
