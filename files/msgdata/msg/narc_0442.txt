I saw people riding their Bikes\nand using a log just like a bridge.
...Am I stuck in the bog?\rOf course not. How silly!\nThis is a full-body mud pack.\rIf it weren’t, I would be squirming\nand struggling to get out!
I caught a rare Pokémon in Pastoria’s\nGreat Marsh.\rYou definitely have to go.\nI recommend it without hesitation.
We’re on constant patrol.\nIt’s safe here, even at night.

Trainer Tips\rIf you get stuck in the bog, you can\ncount on being there a while.\rThere’s no need to panic.\nJust struggle and squirm for a bit.\rBicycles cannot be ridden on marshy\nground, incidentally.
