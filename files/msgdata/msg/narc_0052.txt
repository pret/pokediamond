The books on the third floor are\neasy to read.\rThe ones down here are all too tough\nfor me to understand...
I looked up a book called\n“Surviving Disasters” right away!
The ceiling-high bookshelves are\ncrammed with books.
The shelves are lined with books\nworn from being read by many.
Please refrain from bringing food\nor beverages into the library.
