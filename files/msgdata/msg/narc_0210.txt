Don’t you dare go into the Valley\nWindworks.\rI got ordered to keep everyone out\nif they’re not part of Team Galactic.\rYou’re giving me a look that makes\nme think you’re gonna try to get in.\rOK, then.\nYou’ll have to battle me for it!\r
Isn’t that just great.\nGetting owned by some kid.\rBut you can’t do a thing if I lock\nmyself in with my Works Key!\rThat’s right, the other Works Key’s\nnot here!\rMy cohorts in the flower patch\nhave the only other one!\rHahaha! In that sense, I’m no\nlonger the loser!\r
Ker-chunk!\r
It’s locked from inside!
It’s locked from inside!\rUse the Works Key?
Ker-chunk!\rThe door to Valley Windworks opened!
Floooooon!\r
Valley Windworks\nEcological, Wind-Driven Energy
