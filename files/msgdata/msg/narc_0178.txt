Yo, Trainer!\rYou had me counting the days on my\nfingers waiting for you to come.\rI heard from Volkner what you \ndid in Sunyshore.\rYou managed to light a fire in that\nguy’s heart again.\rHow could you not expect me to look\nforward to seeing you in battle?\r
You’re facing a Fire-type Pokémon\nuser with me.\rLet Flint see how hot your spirit\nburns!\r
...\n...\r...\n...\r...\n...\r...Whew...\n...Burnt right down to cinders...
...\n...\r...\n...\r...\n...\r...Keep going...
I was waiting for you, challenger!\rFlint, the master of the Fire type,\nis up next!\rBattles are clashes of the burning\nspirit of Pokémon.\rBattles aren’t about appearances,\nor what’s weak or strong.\rIt all comes down to whether the\ncombatants can burn hot and bright\for not.\r
...\n...\r...Whew...\n...Burnt right down to cinders...
...\n...\r...Keep going...\rI know your spirit burns hot and\nbright. Your whole team does.
