Backlot: Er-hem!\rThere’s a lot for me to be proud of\ninside, and outside, of this home...\rBut what makes me the most proud is\nmy trophy garden in the back!\rWhy bother traveling afar when\nPokémon are attracted by my garden?\rThey come to me in hopes of seeing\nthe garden!\rWell, doesn’t that make you envious?\nYou are envious, yes?
I know you’re really envious...\nYou’re not fooling anyone...
Backlot: Muhohoho... I bet you are!\nI knew you would be!\rBut I don’t mind! I enjoy sharing\nmy stories with you!\rSo! When I go out into my prized\ngarden, Pokémon come running to me.\rThey sidle up, as happy as they can\nbe to see me!\rWell? Doesn’t that make you envious?\nYou are envious, yes?
Backlot: Muhohoho... I bet you are!\nI knew you would be!\rBut I don’t mind! I enjoy sharing\nmy stories with you!\rSo! This is what happened this morning\nwhen I went into my trophy garden.\rI noticed a cute-eyed {STRVAR 256, 1, 0},\nwhich joyously ran over to me.\rThe {STRVAR 256, 1, 0} ran up and gave me\na smooch on my cheek...\r
Butler: M-Master!\nTh-that Pokémon you mentioned...\fIt doesn’t exist in the garden...\r
Backlot: Wha...\rErm...\rWh-what are you saying?\nI’m no blowhard!\rListen... Mutter, mutter...\nWhisper, whisper...\r
Butler: Yes, Master!\nRight away, sir!\r
Backlot: ...It’s true, I tell you!\nNo lies ever leave these lips!\rThere really are cute {STRVAR 256, 1, 0}\nin my trophy garden! Honest truth!
Butler: Master is a truly wonderful\nand generous person!\rIt’s on his orders that the garden,\nhis pride and joy, is open to all,\feven Trainers.
Butler: Master actually quite enjoys\nshowing his prized garden to strong\fTrainers.
Butler: Master took a stroll in his\ntrophy garden today, like usual.
Butler: Did you see them? There were\nsome {STRVAR 256, 1, 0}, weren’t there?\rBut that’s only to be expected.\nIt’s Master’s trophy garden.
Butler: How do you find it? Master’s\nupgraded trophy garden, I mean.\rYou did notice the influx of quite\nrare Pokémon, yes?\rBut that’s only to be expected.\nIt’s Master’s trophy garden.
You may look, but please refrain from\ntouching this Pokémon statue.
I’m very sorry. But please refrain\nfrom touching this statue.\r
It’s a very expensive-looking Pokémon\nstatue...\r...!\nYou got fingerprints on it...
It’s a very expensive-looking book\non Pokémon.
