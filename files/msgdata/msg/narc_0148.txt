You there.\nWatch this Coin.\r
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin...\r
Now, which hand is that Coin in?\nMy left or right?
Boo!\nPoor show!
Bravo!\nA winner is you!\rFor our winner, I have here...\nA Coin Case!\r
Me, I am but a tearful clown.\nThough I smile, I cry inside.
There are many magicians in the world.\nYou know, the performance artists?\rDonâ€™t you think, that maybe, say,\nfive percent are actually psychics?
