Um...\nWho did you say I was again?\r...\n...\rOh, yes, I remember now!\nI’m the Move Deleter!\r
You’ve come to make me force your\nPokémon to forget some moves?
Which Pokémon should forget a move?\r
Remember me if there are moves that\nneed to be forgotten.
That Pokémon knows only one move,\nso it can’t be forgotten...\r
What? That’s an Egg.\nNo Egg should know any moves.\r
OK, then.\nWhich move should be forgotten?\r
Hm! The move {STRVAR 6, 0}?\nShould that move be forgotten?
It worked perfectly!\rYour Pokémon has forgotten the move\n{STRVAR 6, 0} completely.
