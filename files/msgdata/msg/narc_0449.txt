We’re a traveling troupe of street\nperformers.\rIn place of a formal introduction,\nplease take this!\r
Trick Room is a doozy of a weird\ntime-twister move.\rUse it, and for a while afterward,\nthe slowest Pokémon move first!\rBefore the faster can move, the\nslowest gets to attack!\rHow you use the move is up to\nyou, Trainer...
Let me gaze into your eyes...\nI will read your fortune...\r...\r
A magical encounter is in the winds...\rThough I cannot tell whether it be\na Pokémon or a Trainer...
A brief occasion of joy is imminent...\rBut remember this: the good and the\nbad are on opposite sides of a coin...
An unseeable accident lurks...\rWhether you succumb to it or rise\nabove, it all depends on you...
Destiny shall shift...\rWhether that bodes well or ill is\nbeyond the spectrum of my sight...
Many are the eyes that I have gazed\ninto over the years, be they human\for Pokémon...\rBut your eyes swirl with compassion,\nstrength, joy, sorrow, and more...\rThe ever-shifting colors in your eyes\nmake you difficult to read...
Me, I’m just a simple soul.\nI let my guitar do all my talking.\rAll I need is music and Pokémon.\rI can shine wherever I go if I have\nthose things in my life.
