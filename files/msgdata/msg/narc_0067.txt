Listen, listen. Do you have a Pokémon\ncalled MACHOP?\rWould you be willing to trade your\nMACHOP for my ABRA?
Be nice to my ABRA!\rI’ll be sure to look after your\nMACHOP in return!
What I asked for was a MACHOP...
Oh, OK...\nWell, I can’t make you trade me.\rBut if you change your mind,\nI’ll be right here waiting!
Thanks to Pokémon, I got to be\nfriends with you!
A Pokémon obtained in a trade\ngrows quickly.\rBut if a Pokémon grows too much,\nit will often ignore the Trainer.\rOf course, it won’t matter if you\nhave lots of Gym Badges.
