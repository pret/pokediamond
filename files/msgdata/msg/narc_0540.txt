I’ve traveled a long way to make my\nbeloved Pokémon even more beautiful.\rThat will make it love me even more.
Nothing is too good for my Pokémon.\nThere’s no mountain too high to climb.\fThat’s how I look at it.
I’m kind of stuck here...\nThey tell me there’s no shop here!\rHow am I supposed to get ready for\nthe road?
You know how you can dig up cool\nstuff underground?\rPeople are saying they’re digging up\nnew, different stuff.
I spend a lot of time in the pool.\rWill I melt into the water the way\nVAPOREON can?
