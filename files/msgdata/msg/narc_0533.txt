The cave painting’s meaning seems\nto be this...\rThere existed a being...\rA being so powerful, it was\nconsidered a deity at the time.\rOpposing this powerful being\nwere three Pokémon.\rThe three kept balance with the\nbeing, as if they formed a triangle.\rIt’s an ancient legend of Sinnoh\nthat is still told in Celestic Town.\r
Oh, yes. I found something useful.\nYou should take this.\rIt belonged to my granddaughter,\nbut she doesn’t use it anymore.\r
If a Pokémon learns Surf, it can\ncarry you across water and the sea.\rBut my granddaughter said something\nabout this hidden move...\rOh, yes! To use Surf outside of\nbattle, the Hearthome Gym Badge\fmust first be obtained.\rOn that matter, you will have to\nhandle it yourself, I’m afraid.\r
