Welcome.\nThis is Team Galactic Headqu...\rI’m sorry, this is the Galactic\nVeilstone Building.\rCosmic energy for the win!\rWouldn’t it be wonderful if we\ncould harness that boundless energy?
Welcome.\nThis is Team Galactic Headqu...\rI’m sorry, this is the Galactic\nVeilstone Building.\rWe have no public events planned\nat this time.
Team Galactic conducts R&D around\nthe clock here.\rWe focus on the development of new\nenergy resources.
This is where we, Team Galactic, work.\nWhat are we supposed to do?\rI’m not sure how, but we’re supposed\nto chase our dream.\rOur dream of making a wonderful\nnew world!
We, Team Galactic, will take everything\nthat can be taken!\rWe will eliminate everything that is\nnot needed!\rThat is Team Galactic’s policy!
We, Team Galactic, will take everything\nthat can be taken!\rWe will eliminate everything that is\nnot needed!\rThat is Team Galactic’s policy!\rAt least it used to be.\nThere’s nothing left now...
You’re too young for us...\nYou can join us when you’re older.
I wonder where our boss went...
Saturn: So, it’s you...\rI’ve heard about you and what took\nplace at the Spear Pillar.\rWhat our boss really wanted...\nEven I don’t know that.\rHis confident manner of speaking...\nHis logical words...\rI think people just became so\nenthralled by him.\rI allowed myself to believe his words\nbecause I wanted to see the world\fhe intended to make.\rI’ve been left in charge of this\nHQ building and the remnants of\fthe membership...\rThe decision on what Team Galactic\nshould do rests with me...\rBut I’ve learned that extremism\nis never the solution...
The door is locked.\nA special key is needed.
The door is locked.\nA special key is needed.\rUse the Galactic Key?
The door opened.
The Team Galactic credo!\nEverything belongs to Team Galactic!\rLook beyond the world--space will\nbecome Team Galactic’s!
