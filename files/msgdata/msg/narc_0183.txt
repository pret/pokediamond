{STRVAR 3, 0}: Oh, hey, {STRVAR 3, 1}!\nWhat took you so long?\fI’m fining you $100 million!\rListen up. I’m going to become\nthe greatest Trainer ever.\rThat’s why I’m here--to toughen\nup myself and my Pokémon!\r
Hehehe! Sorry!\nI couldn’t help overhearing that.\rBut the greatest Trainer ever?!\nThat’s going to be really tough.\fBecause you’re talking about me!\rTo prove that, I’m going to the\nvolcano right now.\rYou look puzzled. You really don’t\nknow anything, do you?\rAll right, I’ll tell you.\nThis is the Battle Zone, OK?\rAt the far end, there’s a volcano.\rAnd deep inside the volcano, there’s\nsupposed to be a treasure.\r
{STRVAR 3, 0}: So?\nWhat’s the big deal?\rIf I find that treasure first, that’ll\nmake me the greatest Trainer ever?\rThat’s what I’ll do, {STRVAR 3, 1}!\nAnd you too, stranger!\fI’m gonna get the treasure first!\rBut before that, I’m going to the\nBattle Tower! See ya!\r
That guy...\nHe can’t stay still, can he?\r
Anyways, howdy, I’m Buck.\nSheesh, that punk can’t beat me.\rSo, do you know that zippity-doodah\nof a Trainer?\rYou should chase after that guy\nand tell him not to underestimate\fthe volcano.\rOh, but you know what?\rYou’d better shape up at the\nBattle Tower first, too.\rI don’t like your chances of getting\nto the volcano, otherwise.\rBe seeing you!\r
Howdy, Trainer!\nYou have a Pokédex, do you?\rI bet the person who gave you that\nis waiting for you to fill that\fPokédex completely.
Howdy, Trainer!\nYou have a Pokédex, do you?\rHere’s my advice: go out and\nchallenge other Trainers!\rThey’ll often have different Pokémon,\nso your Pokédex should fill up fast!
The way the Battle Tower looms...\rIt really is a wall that stands\nbefore every Trainer.
I’ve battled many Trainers over\nthe years.\rI’ve gained some confidence in my\nskill levels, too.\rBut the world is still a huge place.\nIt’s not easy to win in life!
Because of the volcano, the land\naround here is craggy.\rThe rough terrain and all the ups\nand downs make it hard to hike.
The Pokémon League’s Elite Four\ncome here sometimes!
Your Pokémon are from Sinnoh,\naren’t they?\rThey’re not what we’re used to\nseeing around here.
There’s no end to becoming tough!\rI just made that up, but it sounds\nkind of cool, huh?
What’s up? Do you want to sail to\nSnowpoint City?
Aye, right!\nIt’s anchors aweigh, then!\r
Oh, right. You’d rather just fly\neverywhere in some big hurry.
Whenever I go to a new place, I get\nexcited over what I might discover.\rBut places I’ve visited before...\rEven those places thrill me with\nnew discoveries!
Hmm!\nA Super Rod is really good!\rWouldn’t you agree?
Hmm!\nWe’re of identical minds!\rHmm!\nTake this {STRVAR 8, 0}!\r
Wherever there’s water, try your\nluck at fishing.
Don’t you like to fish?
What’s that?\nAny advice for fishing?\rWell, I’ll tell you.\nIt’s all about the rod and technique!

{STRVAR 3, 0}: Hey, {STRVAR 3, 1}!\rYou’re not the only one who’s getting\ntougher, you know!\rI’ll prove it to you!\nGet ready to battle!\r
{STRVAR 3, 0}: ...!\nIt’s OK, though.\r{STRVAR 3, 1}, the tougher you get,\nthe tougher we can get, too.\rThere’s no end to Pokémon.\nThat’s what I’m saying, {STRVAR 3, 1}.
