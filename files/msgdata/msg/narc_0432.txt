{STRVAR 3, 0} used the\nSecretPotion!\rThe PSYDUCK appear to be cured\nof their chronic headache!\r
Cynthia: Oh, good. You used the\nSecretPotion I gave you.\rPSYDUCK are known to suffer from\nchronic headaches.\rBut no one’s been able to figure out\nwhat triggers the headaches.\rOh, yes! Can I ask you a big favor?\rI want you to deliver this Old Charm\nto my grandma in Celestic Town.\rI know there are some rare Pokémon\nbetween here and Celestic Town, so\fit will be worth your while to go.
Cynthia: My grandma has this sort of\nbossy atmosphere about her.\rI think you’ll recognize her right\naway.\rYes, I’m sure you will. She’s the\nelder of Celestic Town.\rAnd the location... Look on your Town\nMap. You can’t miss it.\rOK, I’m counting on you!\nSee you again down the road!\r
I know I’m asking a big favor\nof you.\rBut I really want you to do it.\nWill you go to Celestic Town for me?
                                                         
I’m taking a rest. If I were a bird\nPokémon, it would be a roost. Haha!\rUh... You should rest up, too.\r
If they had to keep flying forever,\nbird Pokémon would eventually crash.
So long as there’s a road, we’ll\nkeep on running...
