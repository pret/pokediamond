I’ve shopped here loyally for years.\nNow they consider me a regular! Ha!
Ah, young Pokémon Trainer...\rAs your senior in life, let me make\na gift of this Sticky Barb!\r
That Sticky Barb is a hold item.\nIf the Pokémon holding it is hit...\rThe Sticky Barb sticks to the foe\nand inflicts damage!
Two buff guys standing side by side.\nThat’s all. What? What’s the problem?
