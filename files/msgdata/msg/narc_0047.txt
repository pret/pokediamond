{STRVAR 3, 0}: Hey! That’s the Mine\nBadge! Good going!\rYou’re tough enough to consider\nbecoming the Pokémon Champ.\rOf course, I’m tougher, so it’s\nnot going to actually happen.\rAnyways, {STRVAR 3, 1}, come with\nme to the library.\r
Rowan: !\r...That tremor...\nThat wasn’t a natural occurrence.\r
Hey, hey! Old dude and kids!\nSomething big just happened!\rThey’re saying there was a huge\nexplosion at Lake Valor!\r{SIZE 200}Ka-boom!!{SIZE 100}\r{SIZE 200}{SIZE 100}Like that!\r
{STRVAR 3, 0}: Gramps!\rI’m going to the lake!\nI have a bad feeling about this!\r
Rowan: !\r...That {STRVAR 3, 0}...\nCan’t sit still...\r{STRVAR 3, 1}, I’m worried about\nLake Valor.\rBut I have no idea what is taking\nplace. You must find out!\rBut before you go, let me stress:\ndon’t get in over your head.\rWe will try to join you as soon as\nwe inspect Lake Verity.\r
Dawn: ...{STRVAR 3, 0}, you’ll be OK,\nwon’t you?
Lucas: Lake Valor...\nI wonder what happened?
Dawn: We’re going off to Lake Verity\nfirst...\rDon’t do anything rash if something\ndoes happen.
Lucas: We’re going to investigate\nLake Verity before we join you.\rDon’t try to be a hero if anything\ncrazy happens.
Rowan: Hmm...\rWhat is taking place at Lake\nValor... You must find out!\rBut before you go, let me stress:\ndon’t get in over your head.\rWe will try to join you as soon as\nwe inspect Lake Verity.
What’s up?\nYour clothes look damp.\rWere you swimming at the beach\nright by Sandgem Town?
The tremor earlier...\nIt didn’t feel like an earthquake.\rIt felt more like an explosion.\n
Welcome to Canalave City, the Canal\nCity!\rIn the old days, this port used to\nbe a hub of cargo transportation.
What was that tremor?\nI thought Mt. Coronet erupted!
I’m going to study at the library.\nI love reading.\rI love how reading takes me to places\nfar away in time and space.
An explosion at Lake Valor?\nBut there isn’t anything there?
My PSYDUCK is very close to me.\nIt can use the move Return!
E-even PS-PSYDUCK’s Future Sight\ncouldn’t foretell that tremor!
PSYDUCK: Gua?
PSYDUCK: Gua! Gua! Gwa?\nGuaa! Guuagwa?!
The Gym Leader and Trainers of this Gym\noften go out to Iron Island.\rThey not only train their Pokémon,\nbut they work out as well.
I’m flabbergasted!
Do you wanna set sail?
Anchors aweigh!\r
You just tell me whenever you need\nto set sail!
Ahoy! You just go on and tell me\nwhenever you want to set sail again!
I’ve lost my love of sailing since my\nson fell into that horrid nightmare...\rI need the Lunar Wing from Fullmoon\nIsland to awaken him!\rWould you go to Fullmoon Island for me?\nIf not for me, then for my son?
We’re both counting on you!\rOnly you can awaken my son from his\nawful nightmare...\rPlease, I need the Lunar Wing from\nFullmoon Island to awaken him!\r
Do you need to get ready?\rI’ll be waiting here.\nWe’re desperate for your help.
That Lunar Wing...\nPlease! Take it to my son...
You’ve been asleep for a long,\nlong time... What happened to you?\rAnd what were you doing here?\nNo one’s lived here for fifty years.\r
