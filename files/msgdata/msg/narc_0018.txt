Dawn: Hi, {STRVAR 3, 1}!\nAre you catching Pokémon?\r
Wow! You’ve already got {STRVAR 50, 0} Pokémon\nwith you!\rAt that pace, your Pokédex should\nbe full in no time at all!\r
...Um...\rI think you’d feel a lot safer if you\nwere to catch some more.\r

Lucas: Hey, {STRVAR 3, 1}!\nHow many Pokémon have you caught?\r
Whoa! You already have {STRVAR 50, 0} Pokémon\nwith you!\r
Huh?\nI think you should catch some more.\rIt might be more of a challenge\nraising a lot of Pokémon...\rBut it’s worth it. The more Pokémon\nyou have, the happier you’ll be.\r

By the way, have you participated\nin the Pokétch campaign?\rNot yet, right?\nYou really must try!
Oh, oh, oh?\rYou call yourself a Pokémon Trainer?\nAnd yet you have no Pokétch?\rThat is, Pokémon Watch, or Pokétch\nfor short!\rOh my, you are a rare case\nindeed!\r

Hi! I’m a Pokétch campaign clown!\nLet’s roll out my question!\rDoes a Pokémon grow by defeating\nothers and gaining Exp. Points?
Ding-ding!\nYou’re absolutely correct!\r
Bzzzzt!\nThat’s the wrong answer...
Pokémon grow stronger by defeating\nother Pokémon in battle.\rSome Pokémon even grow into an\nentirely different form in a process\fknown as evolution.\r

Hi! I’m a Pokétch campaign clown!\nLet’s roll out my question!\rJust like Pokémon types, the moves\nof Pokémon also have types?
Ding-ding!\nYou’re absolutely correct!\r
Bzzzzt!\nThat’s the wrong answer...
If the Pokémon’s type matches its\nmove’s type, that move is made much\fmore powerful!\r

Hi! I’m a Pokétch campaign clown!\nLet’s roll out my question!\rCan a Pokémon hold an item?
Ding-ding!\nYou’re absolutely correct!\r
Bzzzzt!\nThat’s the wrong answer...
A Pokémon may hold a single item.\rSome items become effective as soon\nas they are held by a Pokémon.\rBerries are eaten by Pokémon as\nnecessary during battle.\r
Here you go!\nYour Pokétch Coupon!\r
Hi, there. You should stick around.\nWe’re doing a Pokétch campaign soon.\rBefore it starts, I think you should\nbrush up at the Trainers’ School.
A Pokémon may hold a single item.\rSome items become effective as soon\nas they are held by Pokémon.\rBerries are eaten by Pokémon as\nnecessary during battle.
Rowan: Ah, {STRVAR 3, 0}.\nImpeccable timing as always.\rThese miscreants are babbling utter\nnonsense that I just can’t stomach.\rShow them some manners, if you will.\r
Mystery man: Oh, Professor Pokémon,\nmust you be so difficult?\rWe are approaching you strictly\nas businessmen.\rAll you must do is provide us with\nall your research findings.\rIn return, we’ll refrain from causing\nmassive damage to your assistant.\r
Dawn: {STRVAR 3, 1}!\rLet’s battle together and teach\nthese horrible men a lesson!\r
Lucas: {STRVAR 3, 1}!\nJoin me and battle these guys!\r
Grunt: You leave us no option.\nWe will retreat for now.\rBecause Team Galactic is benevolent\nto all, we shall leave.\r
Rowan: That lot...\nThey called themselves Team Galactic.\rWhen Pokémon evolve, they seem to\nrelease some type of energy...\rHowever, I believe that it’s a mystic\npower far beyond our control.\rBut Team Galactic seems to be trying\nto use that power for something...\rAnyway, {STRVAR 3, 0}, well done!\nYou battle quite capably.\rThe sight of you Trainers and Pokémon\nbattling together...\rI made the right decision in\nentrusting you with a Pokédex!\r
                                  
                         
                                                  
Dawn: {STRVAR 3, 1}, did you know?\rThe professor studies the evolution\nof Pokémon, too.\rAccording to his research, 90% of\nall Pokémon are somehow tied\fto evolution!\rI guess that means some Pokémon\nmust undergo startling evolutions.\rSo, {STRVAR 3, 1}...\nLet’s keep working on our Pokédex\fproject for the professor!\r
Lucas: {STRVAR 3, 1}, did you know\nabout this?\rThe professor studies about the\nevolution of Pokémon, too.\rAccording to his research, 90% of\nall Pokémon are somehow tied\fto evolution!\rI guess that means some Pokémon\nmust undergo weird evolutions.\rSo, {STRVAR 3, 1}...\nLet’s keep working on our Pokédex\fproject for the prof!\r
Oh, that was very good!\nNicely done! Truly excellent!\rOh, I beg your pardon, I’m from\nJubilife TV!\rI’d like you to have something for\nletting me see that smashing battle!\r

The way you look...\nYou’re obviously a Trainer!\rCan you tell me what type of Pokémon\nyou like?
The Fire type?\nYou must have a fiery personality.
A person that likes the Water type\nmust be somewhat cool.
You chose the Grass type?\nNo wonder you look so calm.
Did you see me on TV?\nI was in an interview!
When you walk with your Pokémon,\nthey gradually grow friendlier.
OK, set six Poké Balls in my\nbelt...\rYeah, that’ll do it. At most, you\ncan have six Pokémon with you.
                                                         
Hiya, where’d you come from?\r...\rTwinleaf Town, huh...\nIt’s a nice place. Quiet and all.\rJubilife City is a big place, so it\nmight be a bit of a shock to you.
Hello, Trainer!\nDo you know much about Pokémon?
Ah, I see!\nYou are knowledgeable!\rI imagine you wouldn’t see the need\nto visit the Trainers’ School, then.\rBut do visit if you have the time.\nYou may discover something new!
Oh, you’re not knowledgeable...\nBut not to worry!\fThere’s the Trainers’ School.\rThe school will teach you the\nbasics of Pokémon.
Past here is the GTS, which stands\nfor Global Trade Station.\rOh, I’m sorry, you don’t have\nany Gym Badges.\rThe GTS is off-limits if you don’t\nhave a Gym Badge. Sorry!\r
Past here is the GTS, which stands\nfor Global Trade Station.\rTrading Pokémon means connecting\nwith friends, both old and new.\rThat’s awesome!
I’m trading Pokémon with my buddy!
I made my Pokémon hold an item\nbefore trading it.\rThat will make the other Trainer\ndouble happy!
