I’m using Technical Machines to teach\nmoves to my Pokémon.\rI’m trying for different mixes of\nmoves in different types.\rI hear the Elite Four of the Pokémon\nLeague are way tougher than any\fGym Leader.
If your Pokémon gets frozen, it will\nthaw out after a while.\rBut if I were you, I’d keep some\nIce Heals around.
