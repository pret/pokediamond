According to one theory, Mt. Coronet\nis where the Sinnoh region began.\r
...In a newly created world...\rA world where only time flowed and\nspace expanded...\fThere should have been no strife.\r
But what became of that world?\rBecause the human spirit is weak\nand incomplete, strife has spread...\rThis world is being ruined by it...\rI find the state of things to\nbe deplorable...\r
